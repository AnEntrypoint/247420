A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "In 1966, Marvel Comics hired animation company Grantray-Laurence to create \"The Marvel Superheroes\", a series of daily cartoons based on their titles Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and the Sub-Mariner. As it was Marvel's first foray into television animation, the producers stretched out the budget by using existing stories and artwork. Original comic art pages were Xeroxed and used as key frames, with animators adding only mouth and limb animation. Body movement was often accomplished by animating still images across a background. Fortunately for comic fans, this cost-cutting move preserved for all time the original artwork of Gene Colon, Don Heck, and Jack \"King\" Kirby, and the dialog of Stan Lee. It was exactly what readers have always asked TV and movie makers to do: just film the comics. A year later they released the Spider-Man series, with one of the most iconic theme songs ever. While early episodes dealt with the web-slinger's traditional rogue's gallery, later episodes dealt with more generic villains. While Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr did character designs, they were not directly involved in the artwork, and Stan Lee had only a story consultant position, leading to some inconsistencies with the comics. Also in 1967, Hanna-Barbera released their Saturday morning Fantastic Four series. While the veteran animators created their own animation, the character designs by Alex Toth were simple and elegant, and the storylines mirrored many of the early adventures of the team, though some modifications were needed as they could use none of the characters from the previous cartoons. This made adapting the two aquatic episodes particularly challenging, as they could not use the Sub-Mariner, a character that debuted in the modern era as a foil for the FF. While Spider-Man saw home video release about 20 years ago, The Marvel Superheroes and Fantastic Four were never fully released in any form. The original opening and closing of The Marvel Superheroes was particularly hard to find, and is in the poorest shape. The episodes here are made up of the best copies I could find, often from other collectors. They were upscaled using Topaz Video Enhance AI and edited chronologically. Because Marvel used only certain storylines from across their first 5 years of publication, some chapters will have multiple episodes of one character, while others don't appear at all. For example, one of the 5 original shows, The Sub-Mariner, doesn't even appear chronologically until Chapter 8. Many fans my age still remember these cartoons, but had given up ever watching them again assuming, as one person told me, they were \"lost to time\". It is both a pleasure and a privilege to preserve and restore these tales of suspense and journeys into mystery, the first experience many of us had of the super heroes we love so much.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

This show was originally on The New Hanna-Barbera Cartoon Series along with Wally Gator and Lippy the Lion & Hardy Har Har. Touche Turtle and Dum Dum were a pair of heroic fencers who battle villains and heroically save kings, queens, maidens and others in distress. Touche was the brave and dashing leader, whereas Dum Dum was more of a simple-minded follower. Brandishing his trusty sword and exclaiming his phrase, \"Touche away!\" He wore a plumed musketeer type hat, and his pal Dum Dum wears both a smaller plumed hat and a scarf During the run of the show, Touche Turtle used a standard fencing foil was a weapon. But in the opening title sequence, Touche Turtle used a firehose against a fire-breathing dragon, quick evasive moves to tie up an octopus, and a fencing foil made of a nonconductive material against a sentient lightning bolt. Though not particularly bright, he was an accomplished fencer and could hold his own against other sword-fighting opponents. The series did not follow any lasting timeline or continually. Touche had adventures in the Old West and in medieval eras, as well as battling villains during the modern era of the 1960s. A running gag in nearly every episode showed him keeping a telephone inside his shell, and it would ring at inopportune moments when someone called for help. Touche would politely excuse himself, duck into his shell, and take the call regardless of where he was at the time. Home Media: The very first episode \"Whale of a Tale\" became on the DVD Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Vol. 2. \"Rapid Rabbit\" is available on DVD on disc 2 of The Best of Warner Bros.: Hanna-Barbera 25 Cartoon Collection.",

ALSO TWO NOTES: One, the reason 2022-12-24 only has two parts and 2023-12-23 has three parts is because the last parts of both airings were reruns of A Very Merry Bugs Bunny Christmas which is already included here dated 2022-11-26. All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do. UPDATES: All Popeye & Pink Panther's Party airings I have are up to date.",

      "desc": "In Wikipedia Judy and Peter Shepherd are two kids that found a board game called \"Jumanji\". Each turn, the two of them were given a \"game clue\" and then sucked into the jungle until they solved their clue. They meet Alan Parrish, who was trapped in Jumanji because he had never seen his clue. Judy and Peter would help Alan try to leave the game, providing the characters' motivation during the series. Also, Peter would sometimes be transformed into various animals whenever he cheated, sometimes using the abilities of whatever animal he becomes to an advantage. The kids also free another player trapped longer than Alan. Unlike Alan, he saw his clue but never solved it, but with the kids' help he solves it. He called himself the Master of Jumanji and tried to get other people to solve his clue for him, but once Alan points out that his clue (the Gateless Gate) is an illusion of Jumanji's and he accepts it, it solves his clue. It's also revealed that like Judy and Peter, Alan would never have been able to survive his first day in Jumanji without help, as he possessed poor survival skills at the time. Ironically, his help came in the form of Judy and Peter from the future (to him anyway) who help him survive and teach him a few of the survival tricks they'd learned from him. In return, the 10-year-old version of Alan helps Judy and Peter return to their time, but later hits his head and forgets meeting them. In the first episode, Alan reveals that there have been other players of the game throughout time, many of whom left their toys in the cave which is part of his home, but not all of them survived the game. In the final episode, using a crystal that shows the past, the kids and Alan find his clue by observing his roll and what the game said, and figure out why he never saw it: right after he rolled his mom called him to dinner and as he was leaving, the clue displayed while he had his back turned and he got sucked in. Once he knew his clue, Alan solved it with Judy and Peter's help and escaped Jumanji. Outside, the kids decide to destroy the Jumanji game now that Alan's free. In the series, it is revealed that Jumanji is sentient to a degree and on occasion has sucked in Judy and Peter if they make it \"angry\".",

What people say about it? (Myster Magenta of Bible Black Abridged) \"That was hilarious and wild lol. Definitely not expecting so much of a live action element but I still found it entertaining! I feel like I need to watch it again to process everything that happened and I mean that in a good way haha. But seriously what were the writers of Euphoria smoking when they came up with the end of the series? LOL\" (Zach Moore) \"A splendid ending to be sure\" (omkr 01) \"I am amazed with this! The quality is very good!\" Note from the Mikey: My video quality for these videos are in 360p. If I were to render these in 1080p, it would've killed my laptop. (THICC razor blade) What is this? What am I watching ? Is this an anime? (PLnate) \"Swag\" I would like to give a special thanks to Chara Zor-El and Zach Moore for voicing my lines for my final episode. I would also thank Myster Magenta for enjoying my content and my suggestions for some of my errors. Thank you Aniatama for using your cover of \"Pandora no Rakuen\" for my finale.Thanks, Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and the makers of Universal Soldier for bringing the King of Vietnamese New Wave, Thai Tai, to the big screen. Thanks, Bich Thu Van Music for bringing us the original Vietnamese music CDs that inspires many artists to become famous. Thanks, Jackie Chan for inspiring me to be a future movie star and director, I'm apologizing to Jackie Chan and other great directors for editing scenes of your movie and others. I love Hong Kong movies, but I must find a way to make the plot flow. I truly apologize to Ringo Starr in my finale. I would like to thank Makoto Shinkai for \"Your Name,\" therefore it's one of the best heartwarming movies of all time. The reason I made Euphoria Abridged is that it's based on a comment that dare to make Euphoria Abridged, so I decided put my first step to the Abridged realm with my very first absolutely, safe-for-work, non-nudity, non-BDSM, non-2D sh-t, no-sex, all-audience friendly, comedic and hilarious edition of one of the most talked Hentai of all time since Sydsnap, Gigguk, WesSideLive, and Myster Magenta. As a first-time abridged producer with filmmaking, acting, music, and writing experiences, I felt so proud to make it happen. Thank you all my subscribers and my family, especially Myster Magenta, FNL97, Botch Brigade, and Discord for making it happen.",

It is often described as being \"a show about nothing,\" as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.",

Unfortunately, Steve is the only one who could see and hear Marty, which caused plenty of complications.Others in their orbit included Heady (Ron Glass), a giant disembodied head who acts as Marty's boss/mentor, Steve's mother Judy (Maureen McCormick), Aunt Pam (Conchata Farrell), sister Katie (Katie Volding), humorless history teacher Mr. Nitzke (Mark Metcalf), girlfriend Jessica Fishman (Bridget Flanery), and the perpetually cool Jordan Lubell (Jordan Brower). Later in the series, McCormick left and was replaced by Steve's father, Casey (Tommy Hinkley), and Casey's senile father (Jerry Van Dyke), who could see Marty. After the sale of ABC to the Disney corporation and the unexpected monstrous success of \" Sabrina the Teenage Witch ,\" ABC dropped two of their long-running TGIF sitcoms and replaced them with two magic shows, \" Teen Angel ,\" and \" You Wish ,\" which centered on a genie and also featured Jerry Van Dyke as a grandfather. (Meanwhile, CBS picked up two of ABC's castoffs, \" Step by Step \" and \" Family Matters ,\" and added their own magic show, \" Meego .\") Created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, creators of \" The Critic \" and producers of \" The Simpsons ,\" the show pushed the envelope for TGIF fare, and included pop-culture gags galore. Unfortunately, 25 years later, many of those gags are very, very dated. These are duped from an international broadcast and arranged in production order, which is different than how they aired on ABC. Also included is an assortment of TGIF bumpers, some of which are my own rips, some of which came from YouTube.",

      "desc": "She Done Him Wrong is a 1933 pre-Code American crime/comedy film starring Mae West and Cary Grant. The plot includes melodramatic and musical elements, with a supporting cast featuring Owen Moore, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery Sr., Rochelle Hudson, and Louise Beavers. It was directed by Lowell Sherman, and produced by William LeBaron. The film is famous for West's many double entendres and quips, including her best-known (and frequently misquoted), \"Why don't you come up sometime and see me?\" The film was adapted from the successful 1928 Broadway play Diamond Lil by Mae West. The Hays Code declared the play banned from the screen and repeatedly demanded changes to remove associations with or elements from the play, including suggested titles with the word \"diamond\". The adaption was finally allowed under the condition that the play not be referred to in publicity or advertising.",

      "desc": "I kept seeing collections of the Filthy Frank Show that excluded too many items, or were loaded in poor quality, etc. I sought to change that. This collection is 100% complete, with videos collected in their highest known quality available. This collection also includes all video thumbnails, all known video descriptions and the grand majority of the cameos that Filthy Frank made throughout other channels in his heyday. Additionally, this collection also includes the grand majority of the music released by Joji around the time the Filthy Frank character was active. There's over 150 tracks between 2009 - 2017. This was a labor of love to collect, but someone needed to do it. Update Regarding Torrent: (Feb 2024) I hear everyone about the torrent not being updated, I am just not able to do anything about it right this second. Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time. I have all of these files backed up and archival BDs in case of hard drive failures.",

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

      "desc": "In 1945, Jack Benny starred in his last major motion picture, \"The Horn Blows at Midnight,\" as a band member who dreams he's an angel sent to destroy the Earth. The film did respectable business but wasn't an overwhelming success (doubtlessly due to the timing, coming at the end of WW2) and Benny soon began joking about what a dismal failure the film was... which quickly became a running gag on his TV and radio shows, leading people to believe the movie actually was an epic bomb. In 1949, the film was adapted as an episode of the \"Ford Theater\" radio show; the story was altered, the bookend dream-sequence portions were eliminated along with the film's antagonists, and it was steeped in anti-war sentimentality. Benny played the role of Athanael one final time for this episode of \"Omnibus\" which was broadcast live on November 29, 1953 and preserved on kinescope. This version was adapted from the radio show, but with the passage of time, the anti-war aspect was significantly toned down and even more of the film's gags were removed. There are several then-timely jokes about Athanael irresponsibly causing a freak smog which enveloped The Big Apple - in November 1953, mysterious smog in New York City was blamed for the deaths of 260 people, including renowned poet Dylan Thomas. For fans of classic television there are tons of familiar faces, including a young Harry Shearer (\"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"The Simpsons\") in one of his earliest roles as a shoeshine boy. Like many of the other performers featured in this episode, Shearer went on to make several appearances on Benny's TV show. The first video is an .mkv (Matroska, from which the OGG and h.264 were automatically derived) which is a direct dupe of the limited DVD; the second is an .mp4 (MPEG4) in which I twiddled with the settings to try to improve the picture quality - the black levels are deeper, the details sharpened, and I removed an extended reel-change blackout which was inexplicably included on the DVD. Since this was first broadcast in the days when copyrights were not displayed on live programs and there are no credits of any sort, it's my firm belief that the episode is in public domain. Cast (In order of appearance): Alistair Cook - Host Lester Matthews - The Chief Dorothy Malone - Elizabeth Byron Foulger - Horatio Jack Benny - Athanael Frank Jaquet - Ludwig van Beethoven Rolph Sedan - Noah Lou Lubin - Newspaper Stand Owner Lee Millar - Dan Jeff Donnell - Helen Martin Dean - Jerry Harry Shearer - Johnny Benny Rubin - Cab Driver John Vosper - Hotel Desk Clerk ???? - Hotel Pageboy Hallene Hill - Mrs. Watson Beverly Washburn - Angela Ann Doran - Angela's Mother Roland \"Rusty\" Morris - Elevator Operator Roy Rowan - Radio Announcer Mahlon Merrick - Orchestra Leader Directed by Ralph Levy Written by Leo Davis, Leonard Gershe, Howard Snyder and Hugh Wedlock Jr.",

That, for me, is worrying.\" - A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Authority commented that \"the convention is becoming increasingly offensive [...] It's not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.\" - John Howard Davies , the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew Hill's contract. \"The show was past its sell-by date\", Davies told The Guardian newspaper. \"Benny was all right when he was young, but when you're in your 60s, it's a slightly different matter to leer at a pretty girl.\" source - Recently, actress Debbie Arnold accused The Benny Hill Show of being “sexist”, \"ridiculous\" and “terrible” when she appeared on Good Morning Britain. \"I mean, looking up girls' skirts, how can that be right for people to see that today?” source - As the show became more and more out of touch , audiences plummeted [citation needed] until it was finally cancelled by ITV in 1989 - here are four jokes deemed horrendous by today’s standards: “Girls are like pianos. When they’re not upright, they’re grand.” “I’m not against half naked girls – not as often as I’d like to be.” “Roses are reddish, violets are bluish. If it weren't for Christmas, we'd all be Jewish.” “Did you hear about the actress who was so dumb, she couldn’t count to two without taking off her blouse?” source See also",

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",
