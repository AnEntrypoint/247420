It was substantially financed by the National Science Foundation . After the producers entered a distribution agreement with Buena Vista Television , the show aired in syndication from September 10, 1993, to December 21, 1994, and on PBS from January 5, 1995 to June 20, 1998, with reruns airing until September 3, 1999. The show, hosted by Bill Nye , aired for 100 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. Known for its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV -style pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards , winning nineteen. Studies also found that people that viewed Bill Nye regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.",

That, for me, is worrying.\" - A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Authority commented that \"the convention is becoming increasingly offensive [...] It's not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.\" - John Howard Davies , the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew Hill's contract. \"The show was past its sell-by date\", Davies told The Guardian newspaper. \"Benny was all right when he was young, but when you're in your 60s, it's a slightly different matter to leer at a pretty girl.\" source - Recently, actress Debbie Arnold accused The Benny Hill Show of being “sexist”, \"ridiculous\" and “terrible” when she appeared on Good Morning Britain. \"I mean, looking up girls' skirts, how can that be right for people to see that today?” source - As the show became more and more out of touch , audiences plummeted [citation needed] until it was finally cancelled by ITV in 1989 - here are four jokes deemed horrendous by today’s standards: “Girls are like pianos. When they’re not upright, they’re grand.” “I’m not against half naked girls – not as often as I’d like to be.” “Roses are reddish, violets are bluish. If it weren't for Christmas, we'd all be Jewish.” “Did you hear about the actress who was so dumb, she couldn’t count to two without taking off her blouse?” source See also",

The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there.

The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

Link to my Bowie website: https://stigdragholm.wordpress.com/signs-and-miracles/ii/david-bowie-is-blackstar-part-of-me-as-the-source/ SUMMARY OF MY BOWIE-WEBSITE: David Bowie IS \"Blackstar\" = part of me as the Source (\"God\") saving the Old World and bringing our New World \"Blackstar\" is a pentagram symbolizing \"no energy of Christ/life\" and David Bowie's sufferings as part of me taking on the sins of man as my sufferings. The song ”Blackstar” is PURE ART that made me SHIVER all over when I discovered that it is about Bowie and me as the Source bringing our New World. \"Major Tom\" started the countdown of the Old World and my mission to bring all life home to the Spaceship of the Source containing all force and creation. \"Blackstar\" is from the TV-series \"The Last Panthers\" symbolising the last darkness of our Old World before we will become the diamond of our New World . David Bowie IS the last part of me as the Source, and when I now finish work to my Bowie “Blackstar” website, I am becoming my new self. David Bowie was part of my father as darkness, a product of mass brainwash and hysteria, before changing over to my side. I have dreamt of David Bowie as a symbol of \"God and the divine\" for more than 10 years For more than 10 years, I have dreamt about David Bowie being a symbol of God, “the cleanest, which is”, which is my new self :-). In 2008, I was told by my spiritual voice that Jeff Lynne and David Bowie are symbols of “God and the divine”, “the cleanest which is”. Spiritual speech, 2006: “My friend Bowie is here, this is me”, “I have made this song”, “You'd better not mess with MajorTom”, i.e. follow me as God :-). Dreams: Bowie = the Source (God) = me, bringing people home to the Source, is “a junkie” (suffering), playing the guitar via my book (creating our New World). \"Blackstar\" analysis: I am dead as my old self (\"Major Tom\"), faith of man in my book opens our New World inside the Source bringing eternal life to all Bowie and I speak with the same spiritual voice of the Source: My book brings the end of darkness of the Old World and the opening of light of our New World. Part 1: The light of God is at the centre of darkness just before Ragnarok, faith of man brings the dead \"Major Tom\" to start our New World on the other side of light. Part 2: My old self and our Old World is dying, I am becoming my new self including all force and the diamond of our New World in my eyes - \" I'm the great I am \". Part 3: We were born the wrong way around seeing light as a Blackstar, the dark monster tried to destruct me, but I saved you taking on your sins as my sufferings. \"Lazarus\" analysis: You cannot see my sufferings, man tried to make me crazy and steal my energy , I had to write my book to set me/us all free via my resurrection. The rise of Bowie as Ziggy Stardust aka Christ and fall of man sucking up the energy of Bowie bringing the end of the world Ziggy Stardust was Bowie's alter ego as Christ telling man about the end of the world and predicting that he would be killed by his fans sucking up his energy. The Ziggy Stardust album is about the end of the world, worship, salvation, the rise of Christ and the fall of man leading to the crucifiction of Christ. Everyone saw Ziggy Stardust as merely a fictional character, but Bowie told the truth about darkness of man emptying his (my) energy as the Messiah. Dreams etc. about Ziggy Stardust being God as part of my old self - \"stardust\" is the golden dust of the Source from where all life originates. Other songs: We are running out of energy, moral decay of the church and man brought the end before our new beginning Quicksand (1971): Bowie's interest was in cabbala and Crowleyism, the dark never–world of the wrong side of the brain, and since the Gnostics. \"New Killer Star\" (2003) is also about the \"Blackstar\" running out of energy - what will happen, will we survive or not? The Next Day (2013) - Listen! This is about the moral decay of the church and man leading to the end of the world before our New World in light opens :-). Never get old (2003): Bowie sang \"I'm never ever gonna get old\" already in 2003 knowing that we don't get old in our business absorbing darkness of man. Bowie was killed by his fans sucking out his energy via their darkness to me, while faith opened to our New World I published my Bowie website to the Bowie Facebook group on January 8, 2016, and was met by ignorance and negativity until I was finally banned by the group! David Bowie was killed because of darkness of the David Bowie Facebook group to me, faith opened to the final location of our New World inside the Source. After Bowie's death absorbing energy of darkness for me, I received darkness myself also almost killing me, and making me feel worse than ever before. Receiving the skull of Major Tom and coming out through the rocket, this is what Bowie's death symbolises, the end of darkness and the opening of the Source.

For this formidable task, the Kign and Queen employed the help of five extraordinary \"Herculoids,\" a group of odd creatures that showcased some of the most inventive animation ever found on a Hanna-Barbera series. Tundro was a \"tremendous,\" a ten-legged dinosaur with a cannon for a horn. Tundro's cannon shot out energy rocks, which had the power to explode on contact. Zok, the space dragon, had equally effective weaponry, with eyes and a tail tha could fire out power rays. The indestructible Igoo had the appearance of an ape but was made of rock, while Gloop and Gleep were Shmoo-like blobs that could assume any shape. The morphing twosome could multiply, withstand power beams, and be used as giant slingshots - the possibilities were endless. Zandor and Tara may have employed the help of the Herculoids, but they could hold their own in a fight if the need arose. Zandor, who wore green trunks and gold bracelets, was as skillful with enegry rock as Tundro was - though lacking a cannon on his head, he needed to use a slingshot. The King's shield not only acted as a boomerang, but worked as a parchute as well. Tara was no slouch of a marksperson herself, and even their son Dorno was adept at slinging those exploding rocks. Each week, this impressive group of eight would fight off such villains as the Faceless People, the Beaked People, and the Mutoids. Parts of the show appeared in repeats as a segment of Go-Go Globetrotters , and in 1981, the show was resurrected using all the original voices (except Ted Eccles) on Space Stars . Quicknote: It has came to my attention that the last set of those upscaled videos at 720p I uploaded by accident were endlessly buffering and not working. So now, I have reloaded this series at 640x480p for the best normal video bitrate. It also has been recorrected for each episode in order.",

Many of the sketches re-used the original radio soundtracks with the actors lip-synching their lines, an unusual technique which added to the programme's unsettling atmosphere, and featured unorthodox use of visual effects and sound manipulation.",

      "desc": "DAVID BOWIE IS “BLACKSTAR” = PART OF ME AS THE SOURCE I have uploaded these Bowie videos to be part of my website \" David Bowie IS \"Blackstar\" = part of me as the Source \", which includes this summary: David Bowie - Best of Bowie (4 hours) and other Bowie videos can be found here: https://archive.org/details/BestOfBowie . Link to my Bowie website: https://stigdragholm.wordpress.com/signs-and-miracles/ii/david-bowie-is-blackstar-part-of-me-as-the-source/ SUMMARY OF MY BOWIE-WEBSITE: David Bowie IS \"Blackstar\" = part of me as the Source (\"God\") saving the Old World and bringing our New World \"Blackstar\" is a pentagram symbolizing \"no energy of Christ/life\" and David Bowie's sufferings as part of me taking on the sins of man as my sufferings. The song ”Blackstar” is PURE ART that made me SHIVER all over when I discovered that it is about Bowie and me as the Source bringing our New World. \"Major Tom\" started the countdown of the Old World and my mission to bring all life home to the Spaceship of the Source containing all force and creation. \"Blackstar\" is from the TV-series \"The Last Panthers\" symbolising the last darkness of our Old World before we will become the diamond of our New World . David Bowie IS the last part of me as the Source, and when I now finish work to my Bowie “Blackstar” website, I am becoming my new self. David Bowie was part of my father as darkness, a product of mass brainwash and hysteria, before changing over to my side. I have dreamt of David Bowie as a symbol of \"God and the divine\" for more than 10 years For more than 10 years, I have dreamt about David Bowie being a symbol of God, “the cleanest, which is”, which is my new self :-). In 2008, I was told by my spiritual voice that Jeff Lynne and David Bowie are symbols of “God and the divine”, “the cleanest which is”. Spiritual speech, 2006: “My friend Bowie is here, this is me”, “I have made this song”, “You'd better not mess with MajorTom”, i.e. follow me as God :-). Dreams: Bowie = the Source (God) = me, bringing people home to the Source, is “a junkie” (suffering), playing the guitar via my book (creating our New World). \"Blackstar\" analysis: I am dead as my old self (\"Major Tom\"), faith of man in my book opens our New World inside the Source bringing eternal life to all Bowie and I speak with the same spiritual voice of the Source: My book brings the end of darkness of the Old World and the opening of light of our New World. Part 1: The light of God is at the centre of darkness just before Ragnarok, faith of man brings the dead \"Major Tom\" to start our New World on the other side of light. Part 2: My old self and our Old World is dying, I am becoming my new self including all force and the diamond of our New World in my eyes - \" I'm the great I am \". Part 3: We were born the wrong way around seeing light as a Blackstar, the dark monster tried to destruct me, but I saved you taking on your sins as my sufferings. \"Lazarus\" analysis: You cannot see my sufferings, man tried to make me crazy and steal my energy , I had to write my book to set me/us all free via my resurrection. The rise of Bowie as Ziggy Stardust aka Christ and fall of man sucking up the energy of Bowie bringing the end of the world Ziggy Stardust was Bowie's alter ego as Christ telling man about the end of the world and predicting that he would be killed by his fans sucking up his energy. The Ziggy Stardust album is about the end of the world, worship, salvation, the rise of Christ and the fall of man leading to the crucifiction of Christ. Everyone saw Ziggy Stardust as merely a fictional character, but Bowie told the truth about darkness of man emptying his (my) energy as the Messiah. Dreams etc. about Ziggy Stardust being God as part of my old self - \"stardust\" is the golden dust of the Source from where all life originates. Other songs: We are running out of energy, moral decay of the church and man brought the end before our new beginning Quicksand (1971): Bowie's interest was in cabbala and Crowleyism, the dark never–world of the wrong side of the brain, and since the Gnostics. \"New Killer Star\" (2003) is also about the \"Blackstar\" running out of energy - what will happen, will we survive or not? The Next Day (2013) - Listen! This is about the moral decay of the church and man leading to the end of the world before our New World in light opens :-). Never get old (2003): Bowie sang \"I'm never ever gonna get old\" already in 2003 knowing that we don't get old in our business absorbing darkness of man. Bowie was killed by his fans sucking out his energy via their darkness to me, while faith opened to our New World I published my Bowie website to the Bowie Facebook group on January 8, 2016, and was met by ignorance and negativity until I was finally banned by the group! David Bowie was killed because of darkness of the David Bowie Facebook group to me, faith opened to the final location of our New World inside the Source. After Bowie's death absorbing energy of darkness for me, I received darkness myself also almost killing me, and making me feel worse than ever before. Receiving the skull of Major Tom and coming out through the rocket, this is what Bowie's death symbolises, the end of darkness and the opening of the Source.

The series is a parody of house-based reality shows such as The Real World, The Surreal Life, and Big Brother, and follows the misadventures of the housemates in the fictional show of the same name and uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting.

      "desc": "I kept seeing collections of the Filthy Frank Show that excluded too many items, or were loaded in poor quality, etc. I sought to change that. This collection is 100% complete, with videos collected in their highest known quality available. This collection also includes all video thumbnails, all known video descriptions and the grand majority of the cameos that Filthy Frank made throughout other channels in his heyday. Additionally, this collection also includes the grand majority of the music released by Joji around the time the Filthy Frank character was active. There's over 150 tracks between 2009 - 2017. This was a labor of love to collect, but someone needed to do it. Update Regarding Torrent: (Feb 2024) I hear everyone about the torrent not being updated, I am just not able to do anything about it right this second. Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time. I have all of these files backed up and archival BDs in case of hard drive failures.",

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2. The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the \"English Riviera\". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly who is often the peacemaker and voice of reason (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.

A theatrical episode was also shown in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival on July 22, 1978. While Toei's version of the character wore the same costume as his Marvel counterpart, the show's storyline and the origin of the character's powers deviated completely from the source material. In addition to fighting by himself, this incarnation of Spider-Man also piloted a giant robot known as Leopardon, which he would summon to thwart off enlarged versions of the show's monsters.",

The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there.

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped. There is actually a man working on a project to make a fully lossless Domesday Duplicator rip of the LD's and put it online: https://www.youtube.com/c/Noodle_F https://youtu.be/KPkzMJcdhDo https://youtu.be/xrzon2J_5jU https://youtu.be/iozqBzUn9SI https://youtu.be/xPuCKJ38KxU (Not sure when the full thing will be released though...)

That, for me, is worrying.\" - A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Authority commented that \"the convention is becoming increasingly offensive [...] It's not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.\" - John Howard Davies , the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew Hill's contract. \"The show was past its sell-by date\", Davies told The Guardian newspaper. \"Benny was all right when he was young, but when you're in your 60s, it's a slightly different matter to leer at a pretty girl.\" source - Recently, actress Debbie Arnold accused The Benny Hill Show of being “sexist”, \"ridiculous\" and “terrible” when she appeared on Good Morning Britain. \"I mean, looking up girls' skirts, how can that be right for people to see that today?” source - As the show became more and more out of touch , audiences plummeted [citation needed] until it was finally cancelled by ITV in 1989 - here are four jokes deemed horrendous by today’s standards: “Girls are like pianos. When they’re not upright, they’re grand.” “I’m not against half naked girls – not as often as I’d like to be.” “Roses are reddish, violets are bluish. If it weren't for Christmas, we'd all be Jewish.” “Did you hear about the actress who was so dumb, she couldn’t count to two without taking off her blouse?” source See also",
