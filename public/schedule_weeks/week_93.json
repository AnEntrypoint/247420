      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

Its original Japanese television run aired from April 5, 2006 through September 27, 2006. .hack//Roots has 26 episodes and aired on TV Tokyo. The final episode was broadcast on September 27, 2006. In North America, the series started airing on Saturday, November 11, 2006 at 5:00am EST on Cartoon Network, with no prior advertising or announcements given whatsoever. Due to the last few episodes containing spoilers for games not yet released in North America, Cartoon Network chose to restart the series at Episode #1 after only 21 episodes were broadcast, leaving the last five unaired. Starting July 6, 2007, Adult Swim took over Friday nights, leaving the show nowhere to be seen on the schedule and the remaining episodes were never aired. All 26 episodes have been dubbed, however. The anime was licensed by Bandai Entertainment with dubbing handled by The Ocean Group based out of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, Funimation announced at SDCC 2013, that they have acquired 4 .hack title including Roots.",

With the emergence of better copies on MeTV, I am thrilled to offer you the opportunity to experience the theatrical shorts in their best quality. As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

Pondering over her discovery, she unintentionally causes a magical gust of wind to scatter the cards all over town. The accident awakens the Beast of the Seal—Keroberos, nicknamed 'Kero'—who tells Sakura that she has released the mystical 'Clow Cards' created by the sorcerer Clow Reed. Due to each Card's ability to act independently and their incredible power, Clow had sealed them away. Now that they have been set free, the Cards pose great danger to the world, and it is up to Sakura to put an end to them. Appointing Sakura as the 'Cardcaptor' and granting her the Sealed Key, Kero tasks her with finding and recapturing all the Clow Cards. Alongside her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, and with Kero's guidance, Sakura must learn to balance her new secret duty with the everyday troubles as she takes flight on her magical adventures as Cardcaptor Sakura.\" If this Archive Page has any issues (I.E Broken Episodes, Misnamed Episodes, please notify me!) \"CardCaptor Sakura\" is Property of CLAMP & Madhouse Inc, please support the official release of the show via Netflix or any other releases whenever possible.",

All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

That, for me, is worrying.\" - A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Authority commented that \"the convention is becoming increasingly offensive [...] It's not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.\" - John Howard Davies , the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew Hill's contract. \"The show was past its sell-by date\", Davies told The Guardian newspaper. \"Benny was all right when he was young, but when you're in your 60s, it's a slightly different matter to leer at a pretty girl.\" source - Recently, actress Debbie Arnold accused The Benny Hill Show of being “sexist”, \"ridiculous\" and “terrible” when she appeared on Good Morning Britain. \"I mean, looking up girls' skirts, how can that be right for people to see that today?” source - As the show became more and more out of touch , audiences plummeted [citation needed] until it was finally cancelled by ITV in 1989 - here are four jokes deemed horrendous by today’s standards: “Girls are like pianos. When they’re not upright, they’re grand.” “I’m not against half naked girls – not as often as I’d like to be.” “Roses are reddish, violets are bluish. If it weren't for Christmas, we'd all be Jewish.” “Did you hear about the actress who was so dumb, she couldn’t count to two without taking off her blouse?” source See also",

The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday.

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Before the Oscars, before the acclaim, before Middle Earth, Peter Jackson was making some of the sickest, goofiest and most audacious films to come out of New Zealand. Jackson, born in 1961, was bitten by the filmmaking bug at an early age, making Super-8 films and stop-motion monster shorts. Inspired by directors from Ray Harryhausen to Sam Rami, Jackson put his own spin on the horror genre with Bad Taste (1987). A violent piece of sci-fi shlock, Bad Taste set him on the path to becoming known for his \"splatstick\" comedies, blending ridiculous black comedy with grotesque body horror, a trend he continued with Meet the Feebles (1989) and perfected with Dead Alive (1991). Jackson's career took a sharp turn when he and his wife and collaborator Fran Walsh released Heavenly Creatures (1994), a psychological thriller based on the 1954 Parker-Hulme murder trial, one of New Zealand's most notorious crimes. Introducing Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey to the world, Jackson's blend of fantastical visions and real-life tragedy catapulted him to mainstream success and earned him and Walsh their first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. A year later, Jackson co-wrote and co-directed Forgotten Silver (1995), a mockumentary about New Zealand film pioneer Colin MacKenzie, with period-accurate parodies of silent-era filmmaking. Despite their pitch-black comedy, outrageous violence and relative tastelessness, the work represented here does showcase some of the themes and work of Peter Jackson's bigger blockbuster work. Jackson's use of special effects, visual storytelling, playing with genre conventions and, in the case of Heavenly Creatures , mixing those conventions with character-driven narratives. These early features gave Jackson a chance to showcase what he's made of and they still represent the work of an invigorating, entertaining filmmaker even thirty years down the line. The films included are: Bad Taste (1987) Meet the Feebles (1989) Dead Alive [ Braindead in some countries] (1991) Heavenly Creatures (1994) Forgotten Silver (1995; w/ Spanish Subtitles)",

The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped. There is actually a man working on a project to make a fully lossless Domesday Duplicator rip of the LD's and put it online: https://www.youtube.com/c/Noodle_F https://youtu.be/KPkzMJcdhDo https://youtu.be/xrzon2J_5jU https://youtu.be/iozqBzUn9SI https://youtu.be/xPuCKJ38KxU (Not sure when the full thing will be released though...)

Hanna-Barbera's hour-long The New Tom & Jerry/Grape Ape Show debuted in the fall with one major difference from the original cartoon: Tom & Jerry were good friends! As a response to a growing concern that cartoons were becoming too violent, the producers though it would be in the viewers' best interest (as well as their own) to have the former enemies make amends and be on the same team. The decision, surprising at first, nevertheless proved to be a winning formula and took nothing away from the brilliance of the series. Making Tom Cat and Jerry Mouse (donning a red bow tie this time around) friends opened up new opportunities for comedy and adventure. In each episode, the two would appear in three seven-minute shorts, getting themselves into a variety of situations - from job-related mayhem to crime-solving to foiling the plots of evil villains. Now that they were working on the same side, Tom & Jerry were twice as effective. Although all the other characters on the show had the power of speech - and sometimes even abused that power - Hanna-Barbera stuck to their guns when it came to giving a voice to their stars. Tom & Jerry remained mute. In the show's second season, Mumbly was added to the lineup in his own segments and the show was re-titled The Tom & Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show. The new lineup lasted two months before Grape Ape became too big for the show and was spun off to his own series, leaving Tom & Jerry and Mumbly to carry the load. This prompted yet another named change, this time to Tom & Jerry/Mumbly Show; but the load proved too heavy to carry and the show was cancelled after that season. Grape Ape and Mumbly landed on their feet by securing jobs on Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "Hello! This Archive Page is dedicated to archiving the entirety of the Animax* English Dub of CardCaptor Sakura! This is mainly for archival purposes for the people in the possible future that want to watch this show. This Archive Pages includes all 70 Episodes of the Animax Dub of the original CardCaptor Sakura anime, PLUS the two Movies made for the series as well! (Titled \"The Movie\" and \"The Sealed Card\" respectively). [*Do note that the Movies are NOT Dubbed by Animax, rather Nelvana (for Movie 1) and Bang Zoom! Entertainment (for Movie 2 - The Sealed Card) respectively. They are simply here to help archive the rest of the series. Nelvana's \"CardCaptors\" English Dub will have its own page one day.] Synopsis: \"Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto is an ordinary fourth-grade student living in Tomoeda until, one day, she stumbles upon a mysterious book of cards titled 'The Clow.' Pondering over her discovery, she unintentionally causes a magical gust of wind to scatter the cards all over town. The accident awakens the Beast of the Seal—Keroberos, nicknamed 'Kero'—who tells Sakura that she has released the mystical 'Clow Cards' created by the sorcerer Clow Reed. Due to each Card's ability to act independently and their incredible power, Clow had sealed them away. Now that they have been set free, the Cards pose great danger to the world, and it is up to Sakura to put an end to them. Appointing Sakura as the 'Cardcaptor' and granting her the Sealed Key, Kero tasks her with finding and recapturing all the Clow Cards. Alongside her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, and with Kero's guidance, Sakura must learn to balance her new secret duty with the everyday troubles as she takes flight on her magical adventures as Cardcaptor Sakura.\" If this Archive Page has any issues (I.E Broken Episodes, Misnamed Episodes, please notify me!) \"CardCaptor Sakura\" is Property of CLAMP & Madhouse Inc, please support the official release of the show via Netflix or any other releases whenever possible.",

Em casos onde vários vídeos interligados atravessam mais de um ano, todos serão guardados no ano inicial, para fins de facilidade de organização (e.g. um pong que começou em 2022 e terminou em 2023 terá todos os seus vídeos guardados como se tivesse acontecido inteiramente em 2022).",

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

The existing archives on archive.org (https://archive.org/details/ytchannelfiv & https://archive.org/details/fiv95) are both incomplete, so this aims to (hopefully!) be somewhat more comprehensive. This archive essentially consists of two distinct archives combined together - one from November 2019, of both fiv's main and alt, and one done of videos from fiv's current two channels. Therefore there may be some videos missing from Nov 19 to Sep 20 (when their channel was first deleted), I've attempted to add some of them to fill in the gaps but if anyone has any more videos available then let me know. Also much love to fiv, if you're reading this and would prefer me to take these videos down then let me know!",
