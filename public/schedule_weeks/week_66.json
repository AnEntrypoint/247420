It was substantially financed by the National Science Foundation . After the producers entered a distribution agreement with Buena Vista Television , the show aired in syndication from September 10, 1993, to December 21, 1994, and on PBS from January 5, 1995 to June 20, 1998, with reruns airing until September 3, 1999. The show, hosted by Bill Nye , aired for 100 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. Known for its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV -style pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards , winning nineteen. Studies also found that people that viewed Bill Nye regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.",

La s√©rie met en sc√®ne les aventures de quatre enfants d'√©cole primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent √† South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la soci√©t√© am√©ricaine. Mais c'est bien son ton tr√®s provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses d√©buts, ses auteurs b√©n√©ficient d'une tr√®s grande libert√© assez rare pour une s√©rie sur le c√¢ble am√©ricain. Bien que controvers√©e, la s√©rie est r√©compens√©e √† de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award .

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

      "desc": "And now, I present to you a project that has been almost a week in the making, excluding the commercial breaks that will be uploaded onto YouTube. Here is an entire seven plus hour tape filled with nothing but Robotech and Centurions episodes. I had originally purchased this tape (and another tape) on eBay back two years ago (nearly to the day) for $20 each. If I'm going to be honest, I was purchasing this more for the commercial breaks than anything else. Now that I'm realizing the copyright limbo that the English dub of this anime is currently in, I've sort of made it a priority to transfer these recordings before they are wiped out by nature. This is the first extensive/major project using my newly acquired Panasonic DMR-ES15 as a TBC passthrough to boost the quality of my tapes. I must say, without really eating my own words, this has got to be the best that any of my tapes have ever looked. I think I've said this a few times over the years, but I don't think that, within my budget, it can get any better than this. Although I have been noticing that there are some capacitor issues that are coming up on this device (some ghosting in particular), so I'm not sure if I should send this in to a VCR repair store to have them look at it, but it's within the realm of possibility to consider doing that. But for now, I don't think that this will pose much of any major issues. So, without further ado, here are the fruits of my VHS archiving labor for the past week or so... Enjoy, everyone! ~ Broc",

La s√©rie met en sc√®ne les aventures de quatre enfants d'√©cole primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent √† South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la soci√©t√© am√©ricaine. Mais c'est bien son ton tr√®s provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses d√©buts, ses auteurs b√©n√©ficient d'une tr√®s grande libert√© assez rare pour une s√©rie sur le c√¢ble am√©ricain. Bien que controvers√©e, la s√©rie est r√©compens√©e √† de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularit√© de la s√©rie aboutit, deux ans apr√®s ses d√©buts, √† la cr√©ation du long m√©trage South Park, le film . Le 5 ao√ªt 2021, la s√©rie est renouvel√©e jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu‚Äô√† la saison 30 et quatorze t√©l√©films produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont pr√©vus. ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ Liste d√©taill√©e des √âpisodes ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ Acc√®s direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 √©pisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 √©pisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 √©pisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 √©pisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 √©pisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 √©pisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 √©pisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 √©pisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 √©pisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 √©pisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 √©pisodes. + de Dessins Anim√©s avec les √©pisodes de Les Simpson ‚òÜ La S√©rie en VF : ICI !

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2. The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the \"English Riviera\". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly who is often the peacemaker and voice of reason (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

      "episode": "Ep. 27- As Moedas de Ouro - Um √çdolo dos Adolescentes.mp4",
      "desc": "Este √© um compilado de epis√≥dios dublados em portugu√™s brasileiro do Super Mario Bros. Super Show, incluindo tamb√©m os epis√≥dios dublados do desenho animado de The Legend of Zelda. Aqui est√£o todos os epis√≥dios dublados que foram encontrados ou disponibilizados na internet at√© o momento. Alguns est√£o incompletos ou com qualidade ruim, mas √© tudo que acharam at√© agora. A maioria dos epis√≥dios foram retirados de grava√ß√µes antigas da TV, mas tiveram alguns poucos que vieram de lan√ßamentos em VHS. Os epis√≥dios passaram por remo√ß√£o de ru√≠do e foram restaurados pelo canal MaxwelThuthu do YouTube. Os epis√≥dios incompletos foram legendados nas partes que faltam. No caso de epis√≥dios com t√≠tulo em ingl√™s, √© porque est√£o incompletos e n√£o sabemos os nomes brasileiros deles. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show foi uma s√©rie com segmentos live action e de desenho animado baseada nos jogos Super Mario Bros. e Super Mario Bros. 2 de Nintendo Entertainment System. Foi produzida pela DiC Entertainment e Saban. Nos Estados Unidos, foi originalmente exibida de segunda a sexta entre Setembro e Dezembro de 1989. Cada epis√≥dio era dividido em 2 segmentos. O primeiro √© em live-action com Mario (Captain Lou Albano) e Luigi (Danny Wells) num formato sitcom, morando no Brooklyn e ajudando v√°rios clientes com problemas de encanamento, muitas vezes celebridades da √©poca. O segundo √© um desenho animado baseado nos jogos com Mario, Luigi, Toad e a Princesa Toadstool viajando por v√°rios lugares diferentes em busca de ajuda para derrotar o Rei Koopa, que dominou o Reino dos Cogumelos, e achar a magia que poder√° levar Mario e Luigi de volta ao Brooklyn. Nas sextas-feiras, ao inv√©s de um desenho do Mario, era exibido um desenho baseado em The Legend of Zelda. A s√©rie animada de Zelda √© baseada no primeiro jogo The Legend of Zelda de NES, mas tamb√©m inclui alguns poucos elementos de Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A premissa √© que Link trabalha para o castelo de Hyrule, em miss√£o de ajudar a princesa Zelda a proteger a Triforce da sabedoria (na dublagem, a Triforce √© chamada apenas de Pir√¢mide) O malvado feiticeiro Ganon mora em um labirinto subterr√¢neo na Montanha da Morte, e ele conseguiu obter a Triforce do poder. Se algu√©m conseguir juntar as duas Triforces, poder√° governar Hyrule para sempre. Em cada epis√≥dio, vemos um plano diferente de Ganon para roubar a Triforce da sabedoria, enquanto Link e Zelda tamb√©m tentam roubar a Triforce do poder do Ganon. O Super Show foi a primeira s√©rie de desenhos animados do Mario feita pela DiC e durou 65 epis√≥dios, sendo eles 65 live-action, 52 epis√≥dios animados do Mario e 13 epis√≥dios animados de Zelda. Nos anos seguintes, foi continuada pelas s√©ries The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 e Super Mario World em 1990 e 1991 respectivamente. No Brasil, o Super Show foi exibido na Rede Globo dentro do programa Xou da Xuxa a partir de 1991, mas n√£o temos como confirmar em qual data ele saiu do ar. A dublagem da s√©rie foi realizada pelo est√∫dio Herbert Richers. A dublagem brasileira do Super Show √© bem rara e s√≥ foi ser recuperada gra√ßas √† um esfor√ßo coletivo de pessoas que gravaram o programa quando era exibido na TV, junto de alguns VHS portugueses que continham a dublagem brasileira. Por conta disso, v√°rios epis√≥dios est√£o em qualidade ruim e com peda√ßos faltando. Mais da metade dos segmentos live-action continuam parcialmente perdidos e alguns epis√≥dios ainda n√£o foram encontrados no geral. Os epis√≥dios de Zelda foram exibidos como um programa √† parte, mas ainda dentro do Xou da Xuxa na Rede Globo em 1992. At√© o momento, os epis√≥dios live-action desses epis√≥dios de Zelda n√£o foram encontrados dublados pois nunca foram exibidos na TV. Em 1996, Zelda foi reprisado por um curto per√≠odo de tempo durante as madrugadas. Ao contr√°rio de Mario, Zelda n√£o foi popular e por conta disso, muitos acreditavam at√© que a s√©rie n√£o foi exibida no Brasil. Sua dublagem brasileira √© extremamente rara e durante d√©cadas foi motivo de mist√©rio, at√© ser encontrada em 2018. Assim como os desenhos do Mario, a dublagem foi realizada pela Herbert Richers. NOTA: Os epis√≥dios \"Febre na Floresta\" e \"O Mario das Profundezas\" tem duas vers√µes, uma da TV e outra do VHS da Globo Filmes. A √∫nica diferen√ßa entre as duas √© que na vers√£o de VHS, por algum motivo desconhecido, editaram as falas do Rei Koopa com um filtro de voz grave. O epis√≥dio live-action \"O Desaparecimento do Capit√£o Lou\" foi dublado duas vezes. Uma pro epis√≥dio animado \"Mario e Julieta\" e outra pro epis√≥dio \"Rob√¥ Koopa\". O epis√≥dio live-action \"Fake Bro\", que foi ao ar junto com \"Mario e Julieta\" em reprises nos EUA, nunca foi dublado, pois a dublagem foi feita de acordo com a exibi√ß√£o original onde esse epis√≥dio n√£o era exibido.

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored.

Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

      "desc": "BattleTech is an animated television series based on the BattleTech fictional universe, produced for syndication by Saban Entertainment in 1994.[1] Written by Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg, the series ran for 13 episodes and focused on the character of Adam Steiner, a military officer in the distant future who struggles to liberate his home planet from an attacking faction. The series was noteworthy for its blending of animation techniques, with computer animation used to depict most battle sequences and traditional animation used for most other scenes.[2] Ownership of the series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide which included Saban Entertainment. The series takes place in the year 3050 as the Inner Sphere, the central region of settled interstellar space, is suddenly invaded by a powerful human faction identifying itself as the Clans. One of the many planets that falls to the Clan onslaught is a small, mostly unimportant world in the Federated Commonwealth called Somerset. Far away on the planet Tharkad, Major Adam Steiner, a teacher at the Nagelring Military Academy and native of Somerset, receives word of the attack on his homeworld and the loss of all communication with the forces there, including his brother Andrew. Using his relationship to one of the Federated Commonwealth's ruling family, he gains permission to assemble a force to gather intelligence on the Clans and, if possible, liberate Somerset. Unfortunately for Steiner, the only available JumpShip is the Katana, a Draconis Combine spacecraft recently seized for smuggling. The early episodes focus on Steiner recruiting and developing his team and reconciling differences between them, particularly between the Draconis JumpShip crew and the Federated Commonwealth soldiers, while gathering information about the Clans and their technology. After several successes, Steiner's unit is given BattleMechs enhanced with stolen Clan technology and begin offensive missions against the Clans, culminating in a Trial of Possession for the planet Somerset. Steiner wins the duel, but the Clan commander, honouring the letter of the deal, gives Steiner the planet but keeps the planet's population as prisoners. The series ends with Steiner vowing to rescue the people of Somerset.",

View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "BattleTech is an animated television series based on the BattleTech fictional universe, produced for syndication by Saban Entertainment in 1994.[1] Written by Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg, the series ran for 13 episodes and focused on the character of Adam Steiner, a military officer in the distant future who struggles to liberate his home planet from an attacking faction. The series was noteworthy for its blending of animation techniques, with computer animation used to depict most battle sequences and traditional animation used for most other scenes.[2] Ownership of the series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide which included Saban Entertainment. The series takes place in the year 3050 as the Inner Sphere, the central region of settled interstellar space, is suddenly invaded by a powerful human faction identifying itself as the Clans. One of the many planets that falls to the Clan onslaught is a small, mostly unimportant world in the Federated Commonwealth called Somerset. Far away on the planet Tharkad, Major Adam Steiner, a teacher at the Nagelring Military Academy and native of Somerset, receives word of the attack on his homeworld and the loss of all communication with the forces there, including his brother Andrew. Using his relationship to one of the Federated Commonwealth's ruling family, he gains permission to assemble a force to gather intelligence on the Clans and, if possible, liberate Somerset. Unfortunately for Steiner, the only available JumpShip is the Katana, a Draconis Combine spacecraft recently seized for smuggling. The early episodes focus on Steiner recruiting and developing his team and reconciling differences between them, particularly between the Draconis JumpShip crew and the Federated Commonwealth soldiers, while gathering information about the Clans and their technology. After several successes, Steiner's unit is given BattleMechs enhanced with stolen Clan technology and begin offensive missions against the Clans, culminating in a Trial of Possession for the planet Somerset. Steiner wins the duel, but the Clan commander, honouring the letter of the deal, gives Steiner the planet but keeps the planet's population as prisoners. The series ends with Steiner vowing to rescue the people of Somerset.",

      "desc": "Este √© um compilado de epis√≥dios dublados em portugu√™s brasileiro do Super Mario Bros. Super Show, incluindo tamb√©m os epis√≥dios dublados do desenho animado de The Legend of Zelda. Aqui est√£o todos os epis√≥dios dublados que foram encontrados ou disponibilizados na internet at√© o momento. Alguns est√£o incompletos ou com qualidade ruim, mas √© tudo que acharam at√© agora. A maioria dos epis√≥dios foram retirados de grava√ß√µes antigas da TV, mas tiveram alguns poucos que vieram de lan√ßamentos em VHS. Os epis√≥dios passaram por remo√ß√£o de ru√≠do e foram restaurados pelo canal MaxwelThuthu do YouTube. Os epis√≥dios incompletos foram legendados nas partes que faltam. No caso de epis√≥dios com t√≠tulo em ingl√™s, √© porque est√£o incompletos e n√£o sabemos os nomes brasileiros deles. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show foi uma s√©rie com segmentos live action e de desenho animado baseada nos jogos Super Mario Bros. e Super Mario Bros. 2 de Nintendo Entertainment System. Foi produzida pela DiC Entertainment e Saban. Nos Estados Unidos, foi originalmente exibida de segunda a sexta entre Setembro e Dezembro de 1989. Cada epis√≥dio era dividido em 2 segmentos. O primeiro √© em live-action com Mario (Captain Lou Albano) e Luigi (Danny Wells) num formato sitcom, morando no Brooklyn e ajudando v√°rios clientes com problemas de encanamento, muitas vezes celebridades da √©poca. O segundo √© um desenho animado baseado nos jogos com Mario, Luigi, Toad e a Princesa Toadstool viajando por v√°rios lugares diferentes em busca de ajuda para derrotar o Rei Koopa, que dominou o Reino dos Cogumelos, e achar a magia que poder√° levar Mario e Luigi de volta ao Brooklyn. Nas sextas-feiras, ao inv√©s de um desenho do Mario, era exibido um desenho baseado em The Legend of Zelda. A s√©rie animada de Zelda √© baseada no primeiro jogo The Legend of Zelda de NES, mas tamb√©m inclui alguns poucos elementos de Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A premissa √© que Link trabalha para o castelo de Hyrule, em miss√£o de ajudar a princesa Zelda a proteger a Triforce da sabedoria (na dublagem, a Triforce √© chamada apenas de Pir√¢mide) O malvado feiticeiro Ganon mora em um labirinto subterr√¢neo na Montanha da Morte, e ele conseguiu obter a Triforce do poder. Se algu√©m conseguir juntar as duas Triforces, poder√° governar Hyrule para sempre. Em cada epis√≥dio, vemos um plano diferente de Ganon para roubar a Triforce da sabedoria, enquanto Link e Zelda tamb√©m tentam roubar a Triforce do poder do Ganon. O Super Show foi a primeira s√©rie de desenhos animados do Mario feita pela DiC e durou 65 epis√≥dios, sendo eles 65 live-action, 52 epis√≥dios animados do Mario e 13 epis√≥dios animados de Zelda. Nos anos seguintes, foi continuada pelas s√©ries The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 e Super Mario World em 1990 e 1991 respectivamente. No Brasil, o Super Show foi exibido na Rede Globo dentro do programa Xou da Xuxa a partir de 1991, mas n√£o temos como confirmar em qual data ele saiu do ar. A dublagem da s√©rie foi realizada pelo est√∫dio Herbert Richers. A dublagem brasileira do Super Show √© bem rara e s√≥ foi ser recuperada gra√ßas √† um esfor√ßo coletivo de pessoas que gravaram o programa quando era exibido na TV, junto de alguns VHS portugueses que continham a dublagem brasileira. Por conta disso, v√°rios epis√≥dios est√£o em qualidade ruim e com peda√ßos faltando. Mais da metade dos segmentos live-action continuam parcialmente perdidos e alguns epis√≥dios ainda n√£o foram encontrados no geral. Os epis√≥dios de Zelda foram exibidos como um programa √† parte, mas ainda dentro do Xou da Xuxa na Rede Globo em 1992. At√© o momento, os epis√≥dios live-action desses epis√≥dios de Zelda n√£o foram encontrados dublados pois nunca foram exibidos na TV. Em 1996, Zelda foi reprisado por um curto per√≠odo de tempo durante as madrugadas. Ao contr√°rio de Mario, Zelda n√£o foi popular e por conta disso, muitos acreditavam at√© que a s√©rie n√£o foi exibida no Brasil. Sua dublagem brasileira √© extremamente rara e durante d√©cadas foi motivo de mist√©rio, at√© ser encontrada em 2018. Assim como os desenhos do Mario, a dublagem foi realizada pela Herbert Richers. NOTA: Os epis√≥dios \"Febre na Floresta\" e \"O Mario das Profundezas\" tem duas vers√µes, uma da TV e outra do VHS da Globo Filmes. A √∫nica diferen√ßa entre as duas √© que na vers√£o de VHS, por algum motivo desconhecido, editaram as falas do Rei Koopa com um filtro de voz grave. O epis√≥dio live-action \"O Desaparecimento do Capit√£o Lou\" foi dublado duas vezes. Uma pro epis√≥dio animado \"Mario e Julieta\" e outra pro epis√≥dio \"Rob√¥ Koopa\". O epis√≥dio live-action \"Fake Bro\", que foi ao ar junto com \"Mario e Julieta\" em reprises nos EUA, nunca foi dublado, pois a dublagem foi feita de acordo com a exibi√ß√£o original onde esse epis√≥dio n√£o era exibido.

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

Super Show! is an American live-action / animated television series that aired from September 4 to December 1, 1989, in syndication . The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.

La s√©rie met en sc√®ne les aventures de quatre enfants d'√©cole primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent √† South Park , petite ville du Colorado .

La s√©rie met en sc√®ne les aventures de quatre enfants d'√©cole primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent √† South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la soci√©t√© am√©ricaine. Mais c'est bien son ton tr√®s provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses d√©buts, ses auteurs b√©n√©ficient d'une tr√®s grande libert√© assez rare pour une s√©rie sur le c√¢ble am√©ricain. Bien que controvers√©e, la s√©rie est r√©compens√©e √† de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularit√© de la s√©rie aboutit, deux ans apr√®s ses d√©buts, √† la cr√©ation du long m√©trage South Park, le film .

Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time. I have all of these files backed up and archival BDs in case of hard drive failures.",

The show, hosted by Bill Nye , aired for 100 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. Known for its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV -style pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards , winning nineteen. Studies also found that people that viewed Bill Nye regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.",
