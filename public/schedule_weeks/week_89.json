      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

Em casos onde vários vídeos interligados atravessam mais de um ano, todos serão guardados no ano inicial, para fins de facilidade de organização (e.g. um pong que começou em 2022 e terminou em 2023 terá todos os seus vídeos guardados como se tivesse acontecido inteiramente em 2022).",

I also want to give a special thanks to O Tal Antiquado, Afonso Gageiro, Fábio Oliveira, Mais Movies, Diabolik and GoRobotnikGo for sharing the shorts with \"bootleg\" dubs and some of the rarest official dubs.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film .

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

Therefore there may be some videos missing from Nov 19 to Sep 20 (when their channel was first deleted), I've attempted to add some of them to fill in the gaps but if anyone has any more videos available then let me know.

Em casos onde vários vídeos interligados atravessam mais de um ano, todos serão guardados no ano inicial, para fins de facilidade de organização (e.g. um pong que começou em 2022 e terminou em 2023 terá todos os seus vídeos guardados como se tivesse acontecido inteiramente em 2022).",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

      "desc": "Freakazoid! is an American superhero comedy animated television series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini and developed by Tom Ruegger for the Kids' WB programming block of The WB. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who battles with a bizarre array of supervillains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Bruce Timm, best known as a major principal of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, and the humor is unique in its inclusions of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor and pop cultural references. The series was one of the first to debut on the new Kids' WB Saturday morning block of The WB, on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. considered renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.

As of 10/3/18 Steven Crowder has 2,649,014 subscribers 551,234,071 video views 157,135 subscribers joined in the last 30 days Steven Crowder is a comedian/political commentator. He is most well known for his Change My Mind, Crowder Confronts, Crowder Undercover, and possibly Hidden Camera Series. This archive has NONE of those videos . For those videos go here https://archive.org/details/StevenCrowder Recommended videos: TBD His other videos range from meh, to very entertaining. Video descriptions and auto subtitles included. As of 10/18/18 this is most of his videos except for what is in the \"Best of Steven Crowder\" archive located here https://archive.org/details/StevenCrowder I don't think he's going to mind this mirror because YouTube demonetized all of his videos anyway. With that in mind if you believe what he's doing is a great service to the world donate by making a \"subscription\" on his website. You'll get a free mug. The rest of his videos can be found here. https://archive.org/details/StevenCrowder",

He had left the GoAnimate community in 2022 due to the community's conduct, and even though he said he was going to leave his channel up, he deleted it anyway, likely because of the community's nature when it comes to controversial videos made in the past, brought up to start problems in the future. Please do not attack, witchhunt, harass or cyberbully anyone mentioned, as this is left up for archival purposes only. Thank you for your cooperation. May the stars shine down on Vittorio and his videos... By the way, this includes videos from his second channel as well, but the exposal videos have been removed.

Whether it's luring her in and spraying up her skirt with a hose or leaps and bounds to grab her breasts, there's nothing that Machiko's first year students won't try to do. Regardless of her embarrassing plight, Machiko is always a good sport and tries her best to help out her students—at any cost to her dignity!",

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

That, for me, is worrying.\" - A spokesman for the Broadcasting Standards Authority commented that \"the convention is becoming increasingly offensive [...] It's not as funny as it was to have half-naked girls chased across the screen by a dirty old man.\" - John Howard Davies , the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, was cited by the British press as the man who sacked Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew Hill's contract. \"The show was past its sell-by date\", Davies told The Guardian newspaper. \"Benny was all right when he was young, but when you're in your 60s, it's a slightly different matter to leer at a pretty girl.\" source - Recently, actress Debbie Arnold accused The Benny Hill Show of being “sexist”, \"ridiculous\" and “terrible” when she appeared on Good Morning Britain. \"I mean, looking up girls' skirts, how can that be right for people to see that today?” source - As the show became more and more out of touch , audiences plummeted [citation needed] until it was finally cancelled by ITV in 1989 - here are four jokes deemed horrendous by today’s standards: “Girls are like pianos. When they’re not upright, they’re grand.” “I’m not against half naked girls – not as often as I’d like to be.” “Roses are reddish, violets are bluish. If it weren't for Christmas, we'd all be Jewish.” “Did you hear about the actress who was so dumb, she couldn’t count to two without taking off her blouse?” source See also",

This is only a small portion the notable moments that happened when comedians let loose on O&A, most clips are from around 2006-2009. Updates ** 6/11/16 - This archive will be getting probably 1-2 dozen additions to it sometime between Sunday night and Wednesday of this week (week of 6/11), some from before 2006/7 and some from 2011. - A second, bigger wave clips will be added to this collection soon. For those who have been following my updates on the O&A reddit boards, I recently spoke to Rosiebun1 who informed me that there was more to what he had and he would continue to send DVDs when he got the chance.

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "Another channel from my childhood, but this one is still active, so I might update this from time to time. The owner of this channel originally did YTP-esque short parodies, music swap videos, and compilations of footage of shows. Later, Vrahno made Bionicle Stop Motion videos, and eventually settled on blender animations, (mostly of Bionicle, Slizer, and Godzilla). I think most of Vrahno's jokes are great, but some of the violent stuff just makes me cringe and feel shock all over, so some of the violence in these are just not funny to me because it went too far. Warning, if anyone doesn't like seeing Godzilla characters getting injured in horrible ways, you may not want to watch some of these. One joke I do love that I don't care what anyone else thinks is the Zilla projectile egg fart with the visible cloaca. That made me laugh intensely, but that is just my sense of humor, don't like it? Go somewhere else. There is one scene that I hate intensely involving a steel trap, those kinds of scenes make me feel like my soul has been shattered and I wish people would not think it's funny to keep putting scenes like that in everything. On the bright side in that case though, Rodan is one of my favorite kaiju, thank goodness for this information or I might be too disturbed to sleep ever again. This information proves he is OK. abdominal cavity Male birds have two functional bean-shaped testes located within the body, just above the kidneys. This is in contrast to many female birds in which the right ovary regresses, leaving just one functional left ovary. The testes grow in size as the bird reaches sexual maturity Unlike mammals, male birds don't have penises. Instead, both male and female what's known as a cloaca, The is an internal chamber that ends in an opening, and through this opening, a sex organs — testes or ovaries — discharge sperm or eggs. Thank you scientists for making it clear that he is still OK due to having this anatomy. But still... I still hate the way it looks visually. Weirdly people seemed way less disturbed by the scene I hate in the \"Godzilla Gets A YouTube Award\" video than the scene I loved in the \"Deleted Scenes\" video for that video. Do I really have that different o an opinion on what is actually funny than most other people? For the most part though most of Vrahno's animations are just funny, cool, and won't offend most people. Especially the Bionicle ones are just fun in a mostly innocent cool way.",

This archive essentially consists of two distinct archives combined together - one from November 2019, of both fiv's main and alt, and one done of videos from fiv's current two channels. Therefore there may be some videos missing from Nov 19 to Sep 20 (when their channel was first deleted), I've attempted to add some of them to fill in the gaps but if anyone has any more videos available then let me know. Also much love to fiv, if you're reading this and would prefer me to take these videos down then let me know!",

The series lasted 41 episodes, which aired on the Wednesday 19:30 JST time slot of Tokyo Channel 12 (TV Tokyo) from May 17, 1978, to March 14, 1979. A theatrical episode was also shown in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival on July 22, 1978. While Toei's version of the character wore the same costume as his Marvel counterpart, the show's storyline and the origin of the character's powers deviated completely from the source material. In addition to fighting by himself, this incarnation of Spider-Man also piloted a giant robot known as Leopardon, which he would summon to thwart off enlarged versions of the show's monsters.",
