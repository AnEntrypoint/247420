# Video List Generation Fix

## Problem
The video list for clips in `saved_videos/` was stale and not properly updated during the build process, causing the videos page to not play the latest videos.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Build Integration**: The media list builder (`build-media-lists.js`) existed but wasn't integrated into the build process
2. **Format Mismatch**: The media builder generated an array format, but the frontend expected an object format with filenames as keys
3. **Outdated JSON**: The `saved_videos.json` contained old entries and wasn't being regenerated with current files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Media Builder Script
- **File**: `scripts/build-media-lists.js`
- **Changes**: Modified to generate object format expected by frontend
- **Format**: `{ filename: { metadata, title, description, duration } }`

### 2. Integrated into Build Process
- **File**: `build-ssr.js`
- **Added**: `buildMediaLists()` function called during build
- **Ensures**: Video list is always up-to-date during deployment

### 3. Added Build Commands
- **New**: `npm run build:media` - Generate media lists only
- **Updated**: `npm run build:full` - Now includes media list generation
- **Integration**: Media lists built automatically in `build:ssr`

### 4. Format Conversion
```javascript
// Before (Array format)
[
  { filename: "video.mp4", path: "saved_videos/video.mp4", ... }
]

// After (Object format)
{
  "video.mp4": {
    filename: "video.mp4",
    path: "saved_videos/video.mp4",
    title: "cleaned-filename",
    description: "Video from date",
    duration: 30
  }
}
```

## Results
- ✅ **335 videos** now properly listed in `saved_videos.json`
- ✅ **Automatic generation** during build process
- ✅ **Correct format** matching frontend expectations
- ✅ **Proper server configuration** for serving JSON and video files
- ✅ **Video files confirmed** to exist and be accessible

## Build Commands
```bash
npm run build:media      # Build only media lists
npm run build:ssr        # Build with media lists (SSR)
npm run build:full       # Complete build with optimization
```

## Files Modified
- `scripts/build-media-lists.js` - Updated format generation
- `build-ssr.js` - Added media list integration
- `package.json` - Added build:media command
- `saved_videos.json` - Regenerated with 335 current videos

The video list will now be automatically updated during every build, ensuring the videos page always shows the latest content from the `saved_videos/` directory.
