It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off /summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman . It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",

The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "About: Jahosiphat aka Diverged Films is an old YouTube channel that created an influential Garry's Mod machinima series called, \"The Gmod Parody\". The Gmod Parody series is still online today, however, the audio track for two videos are completely broken, and the second episode had its audio track removed after the YouTube Viacom copyright lawsuit. It seems the audio tracks on the other two videos broke when YouTube started re-encoding every video several years ago. Sadly, this is not the only edge case where a video was encoded incorrectly, and others are still out there. Thankfully, I grabbed copies of this series three different times in the early 2010s using different methods that have gotten more accurate over time. The first time around, I used to save them to \".WMV\" and the tool I used had very poor encoding presets. Then in 2013, I started downloading videos more accurately, which is where the \".WEBM\" copies of this series comes from. The WEBMs here were downloaded in 2013, providing stereo audio quality with the best video quality. As I mentioned, \"The Gmod Parody 2\" had its audio track removed, I did however save a \"WMV\" version of the video before it was muted, and it too is in stereo, so I merged the audio track into the video, giving us a high quality video with a mostly high quality audio track. Check sources for the copies I used to restore the audio. Now for the first time in over 10 years, everyone can watch the videos as they were meant be in the highest quality possible. Annotations are sadly not saved, if these videos had them at all. For viewing metadata, it's recommended to use jq and to read about yt-dlp's json convention. One last note, a user named, \"90msg90\", has been sharing around a copy of these videos they have. I wanted to give them a shoutout as I've included their copies in here as well under “Sources”, however, their archive contains very poor quality mono audio tracks, mine are stereo and nearly identical to how it should've sounded. Still, thank you 90msg90 for sharing what you had to the world, I should’ve done the same years ago.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

The episodes are in various genres, including fantasy, science fiction, absurdism, dystopian fiction, suspense, horror, supernatural drama, black comedy, and psychological thriller, frequently concluding with a macabre or unexpected twist, and usually with a moral. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy tropes. The first series, shot entirely in black-and-white, ran on CBS for five seasons from 1959 to 1964.",

From low resolution /bitrate to strange frame rates to lipsync issues , I 've seen it all . So here I 'm putting the good ones I found . Seasons 1 to 5 are PAL DVD ISOs . You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

This collection is 100% complete, with videos collected in their highest known quality available. This collection also includes all video thumbnails, all known video descriptions and the grand majority of the cameos that Filthy Frank made throughout other channels in his heyday. Additionally, this collection also includes the grand majority of the music released by Joji around the time the Filthy Frank character was active. There's over 150 tracks between 2009 - 2017. This was a labor of love to collect, but someone needed to do it. Update Regarding Torrent: (Feb 2024) I hear everyone about the torrent not being updated, I am just not able to do anything about it right this second. Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time.

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others. Missing Episodes: Season 6 Episode 1: B*Witched; Special: The Best of Josh Server; Special: The Best of Lori Beth Denberg, Special: The Best of Tunes into TV; Special: Dates, Goats, and Romance; and Special: Music and More Backstage Pass 2.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped. There is actually a man working on a project to make a fully lossless Domesday Duplicator rip of the LD's and put it online: https://www.youtube.com/c/Noodle_F https://youtu.be/KPkzMJcdhDo https://youtu.be/xrzon2J_5jU https://youtu.be/iozqBzUn9SI https://youtu.be/xPuCKJ38KxU (Not sure when the full thing will be released though...)
