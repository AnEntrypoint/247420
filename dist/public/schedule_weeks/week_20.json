Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

A 4Kids não só censuravam, eles cortavam, mudavam a ordem, editavam e etc. Seria impossível apenas colocar o aúdio nesses episódios. Kirby, Kirby das Estrelas, ou Kirby e seus Poderes (não tem um nome fixo no Brasil) é um anime baseado na franquia de jogos Kirby, o anime foi lançado internacionalmente então é claro que ouve uma dublagem brasileira, mas infelizmente essa dublagem atualmente é mídia perdida. Graças ao NintendoFan, Marcelo Flavio, Ryze, reborn1000 e RGM agora temos 63 episódios de 100, MaxwelThuthu foi quem remasterizou o aúdio e eu fui quem fiz essa versão com qualidade alta. Versão TV RIP: https://archive.org/details/kirbydubladoptbr Informações dessa Versão: 1-4, 7-14, 20, 66 estão com Qualidade de DVD. 15-19, 21, 32, 45-46, 56, 60, 63-64, 72 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em inglês. 56-59, 61-62, 65-71, 73-84, 87-100 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em português. Todas as partes perdidas contém legendas, então mesmo se você não souber inglês você consegue assistir sem problemas. Todos os comerciais foram retirados. Aúdio está sincronizado com a versão original em inglês. Eu troquei de base pra gravação brasileira após o episódio 56, as gravações em inglês começaram a conter marca d'água da 4Kids, créditos a sites piratas e os encerramentos começaram a ficar cortados! Eu usei alguns em inglês que tinham uma melhor qualidade, mas mesmo assim não eram muitos.

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored.

On the Air was produced by Lynch/Frost Productions and followed Lynch and Frost's previous series, Twin Peaks. In the United States only three of the seven filmed episodes were aired, but the first-and-only season was broadcast in its entirety in the United Kingdom and several other European countries.",

For this formidable task, the Kign and Queen employed the help of five extraordinary \"Herculoids,\" a group of odd creatures that showcased some of the most inventive animation ever found on a Hanna-Barbera series. Tundro was a \"tremendous,\" a ten-legged dinosaur with a cannon for a horn. Tundro's cannon shot out energy rocks, which had the power to explode on contact. Zok, the space dragon, had equally effective weaponry, with eyes and a tail tha could fire out power rays. The indestructible Igoo had the appearance of an ape but was made of rock, while Gloop and Gleep were Shmoo-like blobs that could assume any shape. The morphing twosome could multiply, withstand power beams, and be used as giant slingshots - the possibilities were endless. Zandor and Tara may have employed the help of the Herculoids, but they could hold their own in a fight if the need arose. Zandor, who wore green trunks and gold bracelets, was as skillful with enegry rock as Tundro was - though lacking a cannon on his head, he needed to use a slingshot. The King's shield not only acted as a boomerang, but worked as a parchute as well. Tara was no slouch of a marksperson herself, and even their son Dorno was adept at slinging those exploding rocks. Each week, this impressive group of eight would fight off such villains as the Faceless People, the Beaked People, and the Mutoids. Parts of the show appeared in repeats as a segment of Go-Go Globetrotters , and in 1981, the show was resurrected using all the original voices (except Ted Eccles) on Space Stars . Quicknote: It has came to my attention that the last set of those upscaled videos at 720p I uploaded by accident were endlessly buffering and not working. So now, I have reloaded this series at 640x480p for the best normal video bitrate. It also has been recorrected for each episode in order.",

      "desc": "Complete 1977 TV series, sourced from a few P2P uploads. Starring Nicholas Hammond as Peter Parker, the core cast was composed of fairly well-known performers for their era. Other notable appearances include Community's Richard Erdman (Leonard) as the head villain of the second season/series finale. The show ran for two seasons at a 45 minute runtime, and includes three different two-part episodes (one of which being the pilot) that were released overseas as feature films. The series is most known for deviating heavily from the established comics canon, being closer to the kind of cops-and-robbers/detective story that was popular on television at the time. It's also well-regarded for its blisteringly funky original score by Stu Phillips and Dana Kaproff, which is what drew me to the show initially. Approaching with an open mind & no expectation, I found the whole experience corny but surprisingly enjoyable!! This series has been generally ignored by Disney and the independent Marvel before them, having received an initial home release on VHS (and for the first feature, LaserDisc) in 1980. Later VHS rereleases exist, but there's never been a better optical media or digital issue. It was in regular reruns on SyFy at some point in the oughts, but if that hadn't stopped before the Disney acquisition it certainly did after. I do not own these files, nor do I gain from them being hosted here.",

It was made between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series, totalling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were filmed; production ended with the completion of the sixth episode of the second series after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his bid to sell the programme to American network television. Set in the 2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . It follows the exploits of International Rescue, a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from the organisation's secret base of operations in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, leader of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. Thunderbirds debuted in September 1965 on the ITV network . The series was exported to around 30 countries during the 1960s. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. Besides tie-in merchandise, the series has been followed by two feature film sequels – Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 – as well as an anime adaptation, a mime theatre show and a live-action film. A remake series premiered in 2015; the same year, three new episodes, based on tie-in audio plays and made using the same techniques as the original series, were created to mark its 50th anniversary. Other shows produced were Joe 90 , Captain Scarlet , Space 1999 Season1 and Season2 and UFO . The latter 2 series being live action.",

All credits go to Bandai and Tamagotchi Archive. Apparently only three files were downloaded.... The others failed (but will come soon). EDIT: I've just noticed that I didn't upload episodes 225 or 226 and since Tamagotchi Archive has delisted their anime content (not only having Manga), I had to get them from YouTube. So major thanks to Coplen 400 for episode 225 and Lindaaccherry & Friends for episode 226! (Just to let you know, I thought those two episodes were now lost media.....)",

ALSO TWO NOTES: One, the reason 2022-12-24 only has two parts and 2023-12-23 has three parts is because the last parts of both airings were reruns of A Very Merry Bugs Bunny Christmas which is already included here dated 2022-11-26. All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do.

The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored.

If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.

      "desc": "WARNING! Some of the videos and images are not safe for work , viewer discretion is advised. What is this? This is archive of All Gas No Brakes YouTube channel's Patreon content, that had uncut & extra videos for patreons. Originally downloaded from TPB . Why? Isn't this stealing? Yes technically and no morally speaking. Even though Patreon of this channel still exists, Andrew Callaghan (reporter and creator of AGNB) and the film crew doesn't get any money from it anymore because contract expired in early 2021. Now \"Doing Things Media\" (company that made the deal) gets 100% of the profits. And before that, AGNB only got 40% of the profits ( read more about it on NYT, it explains everything on detail ). I personally don't think that \"Doing Things Media\" deserves the profits because of shitty contract Andrew did. Even when Andrew admits it was a dumb move to sign the contract without reading carefully, I don't morally support companies that screws people like this, specially when they were so heavily against AGNB doing political content (IMO, videos related to far right and showing far rights true colors was their best content). Also, extra points for \"Doing Things Media\" being a \"meme viral ad company\" , yuck. Why videos are choppy? Videos are only choppy when you view them on the web browser. I tested original downloaded videos on Brave and Firefox, same choppiness happens. So unless browsers get fixes related to this (unlikely), you need to download the videos to your storage space and use media player. I don't have storage space, I have to stream it somehow without choppiness! Okay, there's one solution, but it's not great either (I highly recommend just downloading the files you want). I made M3U8 playlist for streaming outside of the browser (right-click or long press the link -> \"Save link as...\"). Open this playlist with VLC video player (or other video player that supports M3U8 files) and you can now stream the videos. But beware, because Archive.org doesn't have high speed servers, viewing experience isn't greatest and videos often buffers. Where's YouTube content? You can find it from here . There's another archive that was uploaded before I did, but it's not as good . Where's content of X? I don't know, don't ask me. I only uploaded video (and image) files from the torrent.",

Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do.

The series is a parody of house-based reality shows such as The Real World, The Surreal Life, and Big Brother, and follows the misadventures of the housemates in the fictional show of the same name and uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting.

The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

The show, hosted by Bill Nye , aired for 100 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. Known for its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV -style pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards , winning nineteen. Studies also found that people that viewed Bill Nye regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

A 4Kids não só censuravam, eles cortavam, mudavam a ordem, editavam e etc. Seria impossível apenas colocar o aúdio nesses episódios. Kirby, Kirby das Estrelas, ou Kirby e seus Poderes (não tem um nome fixo no Brasil) é um anime baseado na franquia de jogos Kirby, o anime foi lançado internacionalmente então é claro que ouve uma dublagem brasileira, mas infelizmente essa dublagem atualmente é mídia perdida. Graças ao NintendoFan, Marcelo Flavio, Ryze, reborn1000 e RGM agora temos 63 episódios de 100, MaxwelThuthu foi quem remasterizou o aúdio e eu fui quem fiz essa versão com qualidade alta. Versão TV RIP: https://archive.org/details/kirbydubladoptbr Informações dessa Versão: 1-4, 7-14, 20, 66 estão com Qualidade de DVD. 15-19, 21, 32, 45-46, 56, 60, 63-64, 72 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em inglês. 56-59, 61-62, 65-71, 73-84, 87-100 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em português. Todas as partes perdidas contém legendas, então mesmo se você não souber inglês você consegue assistir sem problemas. Todos os comerciais foram retirados. Aúdio está sincronizado com a versão original em inglês. Eu troquei de base pra gravação brasileira após o episódio 56, as gravações em inglês começaram a conter marca d'água da 4Kids, créditos a sites piratas e os encerramentos começaram a ficar cortados!
