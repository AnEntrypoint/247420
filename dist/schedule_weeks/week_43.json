The Omni Productions dub is actually the second one rather than last, with Super God Masterforce being the first one dubbed oddly enough.

The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped. There is actually a man working on a project to make a fully lossless Domesday Duplicator rip of the LD's and put it online: https://www.youtube.com/c/Noodle_F https://youtu.be/KPkzMJcdhDo https://youtu.be/xrzon2J_5jU https://youtu.be/iozqBzUn9SI https://youtu.be/xPuCKJ38KxU (Not sure when the full thing will be released though...)

View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.

La 1er temporada de la serie estaba dirigida principalmente al público joven y adulto por el cual presentaba un humor más adulto con detalles un poco grotescos, rasgos y expresiones más exageradas y amorfas en los personajes y algunos diálogos que hacían referencia al tabaco y al alcohol. A partir de la 2da temporada se retiró de la serie a uno de los extraterrestres, Stereo Monovici, ya que según los mismos creadores presentaba un carisma muy pobre y sin mucha participación en la primera temporada, haciendo solo pequeñas apariciones en algunos capítulos de la segunda temporada y quedando solo los 4 restantes como personajes principales. El contenido se adaptó más al público en general. Prueba de ello podemos comparar y diferenciar el contenido de los episodios donde se disminuyen ciertos detalles de humor adulto, como el estiércol en donde cae la nave en la canción de entrada con apariencia más grotesca en la primera temporada y se disminuyen los rasgos y expresiones faciales exageradas y amorfas, entre otras cosas.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

The episodes are in HEVC .MKV format. Many bootleg Blu-Rays can be found on eBay, etc. containing these upscales, which I recommend not purchasing, as no proceeds will go to the creators of the original work or the transformative derivation herein. I have reflected the included .NFO file here, as I did not create or host the original files : \"Spider-Man (1994) Many thanks and all credit to the fans who remastered this series to be enjoyed in HD while retaining the original work. Should this series ever receive the proper full release, please support it. For now, this is the only option for fans who would otherwise gladly pay for a Blu-Ray release, but cannot, because selfish companies refuse to work together to overcome licensing restrictions. Please share and seed. \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Torrent created by b4\" I chose to upload this release due to the substantial amount of transformative effort required to generate these files, as well as their marked difference from the original DVD-quality releases. There is no availability for this show on Blu-Ray or HD streaming/purchase, and thus no paid alternative. Other than the sheer intangible joy of sharing something that was meaningful to me growing up with others, I do not benefit from hosting these files on the Internet Archive.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

With the emergence of better copies on MeTV, I am thrilled to offer you the opportunity to experience the theatrical shorts in their best quality. As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "Complete 1977 TV series, sourced from a few P2P uploads. Starring Nicholas Hammond as Peter Parker, the core cast was composed of fairly well-known performers for their era. Other notable appearances include Community's Richard Erdman (Leonard) as the head villain of the second season/series finale. The show ran for two seasons at a 45 minute runtime, and includes three different two-part episodes (one of which being the pilot) that were released overseas as feature films. The series is most known for deviating heavily from the established comics canon, being closer to the kind of cops-and-robbers/detective story that was popular on television at the time. It's also well-regarded for its blisteringly funky original score by Stu Phillips and Dana Kaproff, which is what drew me to the show initially. Approaching with an open mind & no expectation, I found the whole experience corny but surprisingly enjoyable!! This series has been generally ignored by Disney and the independent Marvel before them, having received an initial home release on VHS (and for the first feature, LaserDisc) in 1980. Later VHS rereleases exist, but there's never been a better optical media or digital issue. It was in regular reruns on SyFy at some point in the oughts, but if that hadn't stopped before the Disney acquisition it certainly did after. I do not own these files, nor do I gain from them being hosted here.",

Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves.

All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

      "desc": "And now, I present to you a project that has been almost a week in the making, excluding the commercial breaks that will be uploaded onto YouTube. Here is an entire seven plus hour tape filled with nothing but Robotech and Centurions episodes. I had originally purchased this tape (and another tape) on eBay back two years ago (nearly to the day) for $20 each. If I'm going to be honest, I was purchasing this more for the commercial breaks than anything else. Now that I'm realizing the copyright limbo that the English dub of this anime is currently in, I've sort of made it a priority to transfer these recordings before they are wiped out by nature. This is the first extensive/major project using my newly acquired Panasonic DMR-ES15 as a TBC passthrough to boost the quality of my tapes. I must say, without really eating my own words, this has got to be the best that any of my tapes have ever looked. I think I've said this a few times over the years, but I don't think that, within my budget, it can get any better than this. Although I have been noticing that there are some capacitor issues that are coming up on this device (some ghosting in particular), so I'm not sure if I should send this in to a VCR repair store to have them look at it, but it's within the realm of possibility to consider doing that. But for now, I don't think that this will pose much of any major issues. So, without further ado, here are the fruits of my VHS archiving labor for the past week or so... Enjoy, everyone! ~ Broc",

Prevents Gohma from reaching ceiling so battle can't be continued. 2. 0:50 - No death animation, prevents game from continuing. 3. 1:25 - Death animation commences, however death scene never ends, so this also gets looped/stuck since Ghoma's head never disappears. 4. 2:10 - Weird death sequence/animation (beta/URA?) points to the ceiling a lot, so I assume Gohma was originally intended to die on the ceiling somehow (or just a weird camera hack during the death scene)? Very strange. Also, instant disintegration during animation. 5. 2:40 - No stun on first attack, which is useless. Even if you get Gohma to open her eye, still does jack-all. 6. 3:55 - No stunning after Gohma climbs the walls on to the ceiling. Obviously the same as the first, but somehow in a different location in ROM, which is unrelated to the first stun pointer. 7. 5:15 - Weird eye-hack; the pupil on Gohma appears in a weird location during *some* of her animations. There were other locations that prolonged this weird effect, but I only show this one because it's the same thing. Possibly related to Gohma's animation in it's model data. There was one other I didn't record, which was Gohma falling through the ground after starting, but I didn't bother recording it.

It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off /summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman . It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",
