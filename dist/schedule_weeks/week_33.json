The release provides both the Japanese and English dub including subtitles for English, Spanish (currently being released and episodes will be updated) and Arabic. There will be plans to provide more subs in the future. The subs are soft-coded and require a media player that supports this feature. I would recommend VLC Media Player.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

The film was considered lost for decades. When I was a teenager, my father took me to meet one of directors and producers and writer, Pat Corbitt, and he showed me this as he was working on it. He gave me a dvd of the movie, which he signed, but I never watched it until now. On discovering that this was apparently lost media, I knew I couldn't keep this to myself. This \"movie\" also comes with three bonus videos that were on the dvd, two of which are music videos (which are featured in the movie itself) and a loop of the characters dancing to the Hamster Dance.",

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

Kirby, Kirby das Estrelas, ou Kirby e seus Poderes (não tem um nome fixo no Brasil) é um anime baseado na franquia de jogos Kirby, o anime foi lançado internacionalmente então é claro que ouve uma dublagem brasileira, mas infelizmente essa dublagem atualmente é mídia perdida. Graças ao NintendoFan, Marcelo Flavio, Ryze, reborn1000 e RGM agora temos 63 episódios de 100, MaxwelThuthu foi quem remasterizou o aúdio e eu fui quem fiz essa versão com qualidade alta. Versão TV RIP: https://archive.org/details/kirbydubladoptbr Informações dessa Versão: 1-4, 7-14, 20, 66 estão com Qualidade de DVD. 15-19, 21, 32, 45-46, 56, 60, 63-64, 72 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em inglês. 56-59, 61-62, 65-71, 73-84, 87-100 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em português. Todas as partes perdidas contém legendas, então mesmo se você não souber inglês você consegue assistir sem problemas. Todos os comerciais foram retirados. Aúdio está sincronizado com a versão original em inglês. Eu troquei de base pra gravação brasileira após o episódio 56, as gravações em inglês começaram a conter marca d'água da 4Kids, créditos a sites piratas e os encerramentos começaram a ficar cortados!

This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

      "desc": "In 1985, Turner Program Services was given a 15-year contract by Tsuburaya Productions to broadcast Ultraseven (also known as ULTRA-7), a Japanese tokusatsu show in the Ultraman series which originally aired in Japan from 1967 to 1968. Tusburaya also provided Turner with a previous English dub of the series produced by Tsuburaya in the 1970's for Hawaiian television, but Turner found that dub to be lacking in quality. So, Turner commissioned Canadian production company Cinar to make a new dub of all 49 episodes of the series for syndication, which included new opening and closing credits and episode names, as well as a few name changes for certain characters (ex: the character Anne Yuri was named \"Donna Michibata\" in the dub). Additionally, the episodes were edited for violence, language, and commercial time, and new music cues would be inserted into the episodes. Initially unsatisfied with Cinar's dub, Turner shelved their dubbed version of Ultraseven from airing until 1994, where it was aired on TNT from 1994 to 2000, on the channel's \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" block aired edited versions of the episodes to make it more suitable towards younger viewers and the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" block aired the unedited versions of the Cinar dub episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Cinar dub were missing or mislabeled, and as a result, were never broadcasted on TV. These four episodes were never found, being lost media after they were produced in 1985 and shelved with the rest of the series. However, the show's twelfth episode, which was banned from airing in Japan, was dubbed by Cinar and shown on TNT along with the rest of the series. Additionally, clips of Ultraseven were used for several segments of Cartoon Planet , a show which aired on fellow Turner-owned channels Cartoon Network and TBS from 1995 to 1998. When Turner's contract for Ultraseven expired in 2001, all materials (videotapes, film reels, and master elements) were returned to Tsuburaya Productions. As a result, the Cinar dub of the show has not seen any official home video releases, nor has been rebroadcasted on television since 2000.",

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off /summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman . It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

      "desc": "And now, I present to you a project that has been almost a week in the making, excluding the commercial breaks that will be uploaded onto YouTube. Here is an entire seven plus hour tape filled with nothing but Robotech and Centurions episodes. I had originally purchased this tape (and another tape) on eBay back two years ago (nearly to the day) for $20 each. If I'm going to be honest, I was purchasing this more for the commercial breaks than anything else. Now that I'm realizing the copyright limbo that the English dub of this anime is currently in, I've sort of made it a priority to transfer these recordings before they are wiped out by nature. This is the first extensive/major project using my newly acquired Panasonic DMR-ES15 as a TBC passthrough to boost the quality of my tapes. I must say, without really eating my own words, this has got to be the best that any of my tapes have ever looked. I think I've said this a few times over the years, but I don't think that, within my budget, it can get any better than this. Although I have been noticing that there are some capacitor issues that are coming up on this device (some ghosting in particular), so I'm not sure if I should send this in to a VCR repair store to have them look at it, but it's within the realm of possibility to consider doing that. But for now, I don't think that this will pose much of any major issues. So, without further ado, here are the fruits of my VHS archiving labor for the past week or so... Enjoy, everyone! ~ Broc",

I also want to give a special thanks to O Tal Antiquado, Afonso Gageiro, Fábio Oliveira, Mais Movies, Diabolik and GoRobotnikGo for sharing the shorts with \"bootleg\" dubs and some of the rarest official dubs.",

Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "Thunderbirds is a British science fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment. It was made between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series, totalling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were filmed; production ended with the completion of the sixth episode of the second series after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his bid to sell the programme to American network television. Set in the 2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . It follows the exploits of International Rescue, a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from the organisation's secret base of operations in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, leader of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. Thunderbirds debuted in September 1965 on the ITV network . The series was exported to around 30 countries during the 1960s. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media.

Renowned Japanese animation director Osamu Dezaki was involved as chief supervising director, and his distinctive style is evident throughout all its episodes. Character designs were by Yūki Nobuteru . The title characters of the series are a family of machine-enhanced human beings each possessing unique powers after being augmented with bionic technology. Each family member is given specific bionic powers, and thus they form a superhero team called the Bionic Six. The series was initiated as to be about the Austin family. For creative reasons, this was changed early on in preproductions.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off /summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman . It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "BattleTech is an animated television series based on the BattleTech fictional universe, produced for syndication by Saban Entertainment in 1994.[1] Written by Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg, the series ran for 13 episodes and focused on the character of Adam Steiner, a military officer in the distant future who struggles to liberate his home planet from an attacking faction. The series was noteworthy for its blending of animation techniques, with computer animation used to depict most battle sequences and traditional animation used for most other scenes.[2] Ownership of the series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide which included Saban Entertainment. The series takes place in the year 3050 as the Inner Sphere, the central region of settled interstellar space, is suddenly invaded by a powerful human faction identifying itself as the Clans. One of the many planets that falls to the Clan onslaught is a small, mostly unimportant world in the Federated Commonwealth called Somerset. Far away on the planet Tharkad, Major Adam Steiner, a teacher at the Nagelring Military Academy and native of Somerset, receives word of the attack on his homeworld and the loss of all communication with the forces there, including his brother Andrew. Using his relationship to one of the Federated Commonwealth's ruling family, he gains permission to assemble a force to gather intelligence on the Clans and, if possible, liberate Somerset. Unfortunately for Steiner, the only available JumpShip is the Katana, a Draconis Combine spacecraft recently seized for smuggling. The early episodes focus on Steiner recruiting and developing his team and reconciling differences between them, particularly between the Draconis JumpShip crew and the Federated Commonwealth soldiers, while gathering information about the Clans and their technology. After several successes, Steiner's unit is given BattleMechs enhanced with stolen Clan technology and begin offensive missions against the Clans, culminating in a Trial of Possession for the planet Somerset. Steiner wins the duel, but the Clan commander, honouring the letter of the deal, gives Steiner the planet but keeps the planet's population as prisoners. The series ends with Steiner vowing to rescue the people of Somerset.",

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "Family Matters is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for eight seasons from September 22, 1989, to May 9, 1997, then moved to CBS for its ninth and final season from September 19, 1997, to July 17, 1998. A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

A theatrical episode was also shown in the Toei Manga Matsuri film festival on July 22, 1978. While Toei's version of the character wore the same costume as his Marvel counterpart, the show's storyline and the origin of the character's powers deviated completely from the source material. In addition to fighting by himself, this incarnation of Spider-Man also piloted a giant robot known as Leopardon, which he would summon to thwart off enlarged versions of the show's monsters.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .
