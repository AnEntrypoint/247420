      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "This is the old Central Anime release of the original LaserDisc version of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped. There is actually a man working on a project to make a fully lossless Domesday Duplicator rip of the LD's and put it online: https://www.youtube.com/c/Noodle_F https://youtu.be/KPkzMJcdhDo https://youtu.be/xrzon2J_5jU https://youtu.be/iozqBzUn9SI https://youtu.be/xPuCKJ38KxU (Not sure when the full thing will be released though...)

      "desc": "Freakazoid! is an American superhero comedy animated television series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini and developed by Tom Ruegger for the Kids' WB programming block of The WB. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who battles with a bizarre array of supervillains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Bruce Timm, best known as a major principal of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, and the humor is unique in its inclusions of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor and pop cultural references. The series was one of the first to debut on the new Kids' WB Saturday morning block of The WB, on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. considered renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.

With the emergence of better copies on MeTV, I am thrilled to offer you the opportunity to experience the theatrical shorts in their best quality. As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

This collection also includes all video thumbnails, all known video descriptions and the grand majority of the cameos that Filthy Frank made throughout other channels in his heyday. Additionally, this collection also includes the grand majority of the music released by Joji around the time the Filthy Frank character was active. There's over 150 tracks between 2009 - 2017. This was a labor of love to collect, but someone needed to do it. Update Regarding Torrent: (Feb 2024) I hear everyone about the torrent not being updated, I am just not able to do anything about it right this second. Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time.

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others. Missing Episodes: Season 6 Episode 1: B*Witched; Special: The Best of Josh Server; Special: The Best of Lori Beth Denberg, Special: The Best of Tunes into TV; Special: Dates, Goats, and Romance; and Special: Music and More Backstage Pass 2.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

      "desc": "In 1985, Turner Program Services was given a 15-year contract by Tsuburaya Productions to broadcast Ultraseven (also known as ULTRA-7), a Japanese tokusatsu show in the Ultraman series which originally aired in Japan from 1967 to 1968. Tusburaya also provided Turner with a previous English dub of the series produced by Tsuburaya in the 1970's for Hawaiian television, but Turner found that dub to be lacking in quality. So, Turner commissioned Canadian production company Cinar to make a new dub of all 49 episodes of the series for syndication, which included new opening and closing credits and episode names, as well as a few name changes for certain characters (ex: the character Anne Yuri was named \"Donna Michibata\" in the dub). Additionally, the episodes were edited for violence, language, and commercial time, and new music cues would be inserted into the episodes. Initially unsatisfied with Cinar's dub, Turner shelved their dubbed version of Ultraseven from airing until 1994, where it was aired on TNT from 1994 to 2000, on the channel's \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" block aired edited versions of the episodes to make it more suitable towards younger viewers and the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" block aired the unedited versions of the Cinar dub episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Cinar dub were missing or mislabeled, and as a result, were never broadcasted on TV. These four episodes were never found, being lost media after they were produced in 1985 and shelved with the rest of the series. However, the show's twelfth episode, which was banned from airing in Japan, was dubbed by Cinar and shown on TNT along with the rest of the series. Additionally, clips of Ultraseven were used for several segments of Cartoon Planet , a show which aired on fellow Turner-owned channels Cartoon Network and TBS from 1995 to 1998. When Turner's contract for Ultraseven expired in 2001, all materials (videotapes, film reels, and master elements) were returned to Tsuburaya Productions. As a result, the Cinar dub of the show has not seen any official home video releases, nor has been rebroadcasted on television since 2000.",

ALSO TWO NOTES: One, the reason 2022-12-24 only has two parts and 2023-12-23 has three parts is because the last parts of both airings were reruns of A Very Merry Bugs Bunny Christmas which is already included here dated 2022-11-26. All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do. UPDATES: All Popeye & Pink Panther's Party airings I have are up to date.",

From low resolution /bitrate to strange frame rates to lipsync issues , I 've seen it all . So here I 'm putting the good ones I found . Seasons 1 to 5 are PAL DVD ISOs . You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles . Seasons 6 -10 have additional subtitle tracks for various European languages .",

This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel.

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film .

Super Show! is an American live-action / animated television series that aired from September 4 to December 1, 1989, in syndication . The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video.

It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",
