      "desc": "Family Matters is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for eight seasons from September 22, 1989, to May 9, 1997, then moved to CBS for its ninth and final season from September 19, 1997, to July 17, 1998. A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

A 4Kids não só censuravam, eles cortavam, mudavam a ordem, editavam e etc. Seria impossível apenas colocar o aúdio nesses episódios. Kirby, Kirby das Estrelas, ou Kirby e seus Poderes (não tem um nome fixo no Brasil) é um anime baseado na franquia de jogos Kirby, o anime foi lançado internacionalmente então é claro que ouve uma dublagem brasileira, mas infelizmente essa dublagem atualmente é mídia perdida. Graças ao NintendoFan, Marcelo Flavio, Ryze, reborn1000 e RGM agora temos 63 episódios de 100, MaxwelThuthu foi quem remasterizou o aúdio e eu fui quem fiz essa versão com qualidade alta. Versão TV RIP: https://archive.org/details/kirbydubladoptbr Informações dessa Versão: 1-4, 7-14, 20, 66 estão com Qualidade de DVD. 15-19, 21, 32, 45-46, 56, 60, 63-64, 72 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em inglês. 56-59, 61-62, 65-71, 73-84, 87-100 estão com Qualidade das Gravações em português. Todas as partes perdidas contém legendas, então mesmo se você não souber inglês você consegue assistir sem problemas. Todos os comerciais foram retirados.

With the emergence of better copies on MeTV, I am thrilled to offer you the opportunity to experience the theatrical shorts in their best quality. As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "episode": "Marvel Super Heroes 07.Thor's Big Week.mp4",
      "desc": "In 1966, Marvel Comics hired animation company Grantray-Laurence to create \"The Marvel Superheroes\", a series of daily cartoons based on their titles Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and the Sub-Mariner. As it was Marvel's first foray into television animation, the producers stretched out the budget by using existing stories and artwork. Original comic art pages were Xeroxed and used as key frames, with animators adding only mouth and limb animation. Body movement was often accomplished by animating still images across a background. Fortunately for comic fans, this cost-cutting move preserved for all time the original artwork of Gene Colon, Don Heck, and Jack \"King\" Kirby, and the dialog of Stan Lee. It was exactly what readers have always asked TV and movie makers to do: just film the comics. A year later they released the Spider-Man series, with one of the most iconic theme songs ever. While early episodes dealt with the web-slinger's traditional rogue's gallery, later episodes dealt with more generic villains. While Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr did character designs, they were not directly involved in the artwork, and Stan Lee had only a story consultant position, leading to some inconsistencies with the comics. Also in 1967, Hanna-Barbera released their Saturday morning Fantastic Four series. While the veteran animators created their own animation, the character designs by Alex Toth were simple and elegant, and the storylines mirrored many of the early adventures of the team, though some modifications were needed as they could use none of the characters from the previous cartoons. This made adapting the two aquatic episodes particularly challenging, as they could not use the Sub-Mariner, a character that debuted in the modern era as a foil for the FF. While Spider-Man saw home video release about 20 years ago, The Marvel Superheroes and Fantastic Four were never fully released in any form. The original opening and closing of The Marvel Superheroes was particularly hard to find, and is in the poorest shape. The episodes here are made up of the best copies I could find, often from other collectors. They were upscaled using Topaz Video Enhance AI and edited chronologically. Because Marvel used only certain storylines from across their first 5 years of publication, some chapters will have multiple episodes of one character, while others don't appear at all. For example, one of the 5 original shows, The Sub-Mariner, doesn't even appear chronologically until Chapter 8. Many fans my age still remember these cartoons, but had given up ever watching them again assuming, as one person told me, they were \"lost to time\". It is both a pleasure and a privilege to preserve and restore these tales of suspense and journeys into mystery, the first experience many of us had of the super heroes we love so much.",

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public.

Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles .

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

For this formidable task, the Kign and Queen employed the help of five extraordinary \"Herculoids,\" a group of odd creatures that showcased some of the most inventive animation ever found on a Hanna-Barbera series. Tundro was a \"tremendous,\" a ten-legged dinosaur with a cannon for a horn. Tundro's cannon shot out energy rocks, which had the power to explode on contact. Zok, the space dragon, had equally effective weaponry, with eyes and a tail tha could fire out power rays. The indestructible Igoo had the appearance of an ape but was made of rock, while Gloop and Gleep were Shmoo-like blobs that could assume any shape. The morphing twosome could multiply, withstand power beams, and be used as giant slingshots - the possibilities were endless. Zandor and Tara may have employed the help of the Herculoids, but they could hold their own in a fight if the need arose. Zandor, who wore green trunks and gold bracelets, was as skillful with enegry rock as Tundro was - though lacking a cannon on his head, he needed to use a slingshot. The King's shield not only acted as a boomerang, but worked as a parchute as well. Tara was no slouch of a marksperson herself, and even their son Dorno was adept at slinging those exploding rocks. Each week, this impressive group of eight would fight off such villains as the Faceless People, the Beaked People, and the Mutoids. Parts of the show appeared in repeats as a segment of Go-Go Globetrotters , and in 1981, the show was resurrected using all the original voices (except Ted Eccles) on Space Stars . Quicknote: It has came to my attention that the last set of those upscaled videos at 720p I uploaded by accident were endlessly buffering and not working. So now, I have reloaded this series at 640x480p for the best normal video bitrate. It also has been recorrected for each episode in order.",

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do.
