The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2. The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the \"English Riviera\". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly who is often the peacemaker and voice of reason (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

      "desc": "Verbatim extracted README below (I am not Niklink). Videos acquired from: https://mega.nz/folder/SAEzEaQC#4fX4Z8RxTd2Qx49qDAWHxg and this reddit post: https://redd.it/qrztqq -- This is an archive of unlisted Homestuck-related videos that you can no longer find at their original Youtube uploads. Most have also been reuploaded to Youtube for easier viewing and can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVq5p3x9Eh_M5hURrx6ae3Su_brVQJ_ When a video is 'unlisted' it means it can only viewed if you already have the direct link to it. In 2021, Google announced that all unlisted videos on Youtube uploaded before 2017 would be automatically set to 'private' (only the uploader can view and share) on July 23, 2021. The reason isn't really super important (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230970?hl=en), but unless you opted out of the change manually, the videos would be essentially lost to the public. With the Homestuck fandom having had its heyday, most channels were abandoned or unmaintained, so obviously most videos would be lost. So I backed up everything I could find and here we are. Enjoy! What's the difference between 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' videos? 'Accepted' videos are ones that are either by notable Homestuck people, are particularly funny or high-effort, or were especially popular (80k+ view count). 'Rejected' is everything else. Some of it's alright, some of it is garbage, but it's here if you want it. What's this stuff under 'Misc.'? Metadata stuff. The thumbnails are their original Youtube thumbnails and the JSONs contain all sort of info like tags, view count, likes/dislikes, etcetera. It's just there for thoroughness. Is it okay to rerelease all this stuff? Well, the original creators had this stuff hidden, but specifically not unavailable. And it's a fair assumption that only a very small percentage, if any, of the creators was notified about this forced change and independently decided that they'd prefer their videos set to private anyways. Of all the unlisted videos I tracked down, less than 5% manually opted out of the change of their own volition. This whole thing kind of flew under the radar, I mean you probably didn't hear about it until now even though it shredded a huge amount of important Youtube videos of all sorts. Okay, but -I'm- one of these creators and I'd like my content to be private? Contact me and we'll get it sorted out. You can find me on Reddit or the Homestuck Discord as 'Niklink'.",

La 1er temporada de la serie estaba dirigida principalmente al público joven y adulto por el cual presentaba un humor más adulto con detalles un poco grotescos, rasgos y expresiones más exageradas y amorfas en los personajes y algunos diálogos que hacían referencia al tabaco y al alcohol. A partir de la 2da temporada se retiró de la serie a uno de los extraterrestres, Stereo Monovici, ya que según los mismos creadores presentaba un carisma muy pobre y sin mucha participación en la primera temporada, haciendo solo pequeñas apariciones en algunos capítulos de la segunda temporada y quedando solo los 4 restantes como personajes principales. El contenido se adaptó más al público en general. Prueba de ello podemos comparar y diferenciar el contenido de los episodios donde se disminuyen ciertos detalles de humor adulto, como el estiércol en donde cae la nave en la canción de entrada con apariencia más grotesca en la primera temporada y se disminuyen los rasgos y expresiones faciales exageradas y amorfas, entre otras cosas.",

From low resolution /bitrate to strange frame rates to lipsync issues , I 've seen it all . So here I 'm putting the good ones I found . Seasons 1 to 5 are PAL DVD ISOs . You can play them at the correct 24fps in VLC by setting the playback rate to 0 .96 and disabling time -stretching audio . Leave deinterlacing OFF for best picture . The first two series have extras ; the rest don 't . S1D1 and S3D3 were ripped with read errors ignored. I will not rip season 6 onwards from DVD as genuine copies are rare and they're poor releases anyway (no extras, static menus). Seasons 6 -10 are pillarboxed widescreen . If cropping , beware the image within the frame is a smidgen wider than 4 : 3 . They have been upscaled from NTSC to 1080p with mixed results . Seasons 11 onwards are high definition , 4 :3 or 1 6 :9 (S13E08 onwards ) as appropriate , except S11E12 which is 480p. All episodes have English subtitles . Seasons 6 -10 have additional subtitle tracks for various European languages .",

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them.

Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others.

      "desc": "Here’s a rare look of the original 1997 version of the very first SpongeBob SquarePants episode ever, Help Wanted. This was sourced from the incredibly rare The Best of Nicktoons 1998 tape which was exclusively given out to employees that worked at Nickelodeon Animation Studios and it’s the first piece of home video of SpongeBob SquarePants despite it was never sold in stores and this was four years before the earliest home video releases of the show Nautical Nonsense and Sponge Buddies was released on VHS in March 15, 2002. Because of its rarity the tape and the original 1997 version became lost media which it wasn’t noticed by the public until a clip of it featuring the intro was uploaded on RetroJunk in 2009. And the version wouldn’t get uploaded until 2015 but then taken down then uploaded again in 2018, 2019, and 2020 which now the 1997 version is safely archived which it is available out there on the web. The 1997 version contains differences like there’s no bubble transition in the beginning, deleted animation of SpongeBob running and saying “I’m ready!”, an announcer saying “SpongeBob SquarePants!”, then transitions into four unique title cards, the ending fades out more and doesn’t have the sound effects continue, several errors in the end credits which can be read on the SpongeBob wiki, a different logo appears that has text “Created By Stephen Hillenburg” with a sketch of SpongeBob that would end up appearing at the end of the intro of the final version of the show which is why United Plankton Pictures is not there because it wasn’t made yet at the time, and lastly the copyright date is 1997 not 1999 since the pilot was made that same year. This rip of the tape was found by archive.org user 3DyIanStar on June 8, 2023. This recording of the 1997 version has cleaner audio quality than the previous uploads online while the video quality is not the sharpest looking there is no ghosting at least and the framerate is consistent. So special thanks to 3DyIanStar for finding this piece of Nickelodeon and SpongeBob history can’t share the link because of Viacom, but typing the name on the site shouldn’t be hard to find.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

      "desc": "South Park ☆ La Série ☆ VF South Park (prononcé : [saʊθ pɑːɹk] ) est une série d'animation américaine pour adultes créée et écrite par Trey Parker et Matt Stone , diffusée depuis le 13 août 1997 sur Comedy Central . La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

Super Show! is an American live-action / animated television series that aired from September 4 to December 1, 1989, in syndication . The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

      "desc": "This is a lossless rip I created of the Mad Bull 34 OVA's from 1990, this rip is based on a ISO of the 2013 Discotek Media release of the show on DVD. This rip contains: -720x480i video at ~5665kbps (bitrate will varies a little between episodes) -AC-3 stereo audio (2.0) -The Manga Entertainment dub (160kbps) -Original Japanese audio (192kbps) -Signs and credits subtitles (VobSub) -Full English Subtitles (VobSub) I have the English dub and it's accompanying signs/credits subs as the default since I believe watching this show dubbed is the best way to watch it, although I have set the Japanese audio and the full subs for it set as Japanese in the files metadata so if you set your default language on VLC to Japanese then folk who want to watch that way won't have to change the language every episode and can just play it on a playlist. Also a quick note on this release, Discotek media announced back in December of 2020 that they lost the license to the show so the chances of it getting a more modern BD or SD-BD release is very unlikely, however this release actually looks fantastic despite being in standard definition, another thing I noticed is that even though it is interlaced you can barely see the interlacing whatsoever when you turn off the deinterlacer in VLC. Basically what I am saying is that this is a really great release and it could make a great basis for a later upscale if I ever get around to it. Here is the DVD ISO I made my rip from: https://nyaa.si/view/409828 Original Description: America - land of freedom. But on its dark streets prowl those who abuse its freedoms, and nowhere is as crime-ridden as New York City. It is the job of the New York Police Department to protect society from the evil on its streets, and this is the tale of New York's finest cops, serving in its toughest district - the 34th Precinct. Into this melting pot of crime and corruption comes a raw young recruit named Daizaburo. His new partner is one of the most notorious cops on the force - known to co-workers as Mad Bull, due to his ultra-violent form of peace keeping! Shocking, action-packed and explosive, Mad Bull 34 is finally available on DVD in this complete collection!

      "show": "Super Mario Bros. Super Show! e Zelda - Episódios Dublados - Português Brasil",
      "episode": "Ep. 41- Karatê Koopa - Adee Don't.mp4",
      "desc": "Este é um compilado de episódios dublados em português brasileiro do Super Mario Bros. Super Show, incluindo também os episódios dublados do desenho animado de The Legend of Zelda. Aqui estão todos os episódios dublados que foram encontrados ou disponibilizados na internet até o momento. Alguns estão incompletos ou com qualidade ruim, mas é tudo que acharam até agora. A maioria dos episódios foram retirados de gravações antigas da TV, mas tiveram alguns poucos que vieram de lançamentos em VHS. Os episódios passaram por remoção de ruído e foram restaurados pelo canal MaxwelThuthu do YouTube. Os episódios incompletos foram legendados nas partes que faltam. No caso de episódios com título em inglês, é porque estão incompletos e não sabemos os nomes brasileiros deles. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show foi uma série com segmentos live action e de desenho animado baseada nos jogos Super Mario Bros. e Super Mario Bros. 2 de Nintendo Entertainment System. Foi produzida pela DiC Entertainment e Saban. Nos Estados Unidos, foi originalmente exibida de segunda a sexta entre Setembro e Dezembro de 1989. Cada episódio era dividido em 2 segmentos. O primeiro é em live-action com Mario (Captain Lou Albano) e Luigi (Danny Wells) num formato sitcom, morando no Brooklyn e ajudando vários clientes com problemas de encanamento, muitas vezes celebridades da época. O segundo é um desenho animado baseado nos jogos com Mario, Luigi, Toad e a Princesa Toadstool viajando por vários lugares diferentes em busca de ajuda para derrotar o Rei Koopa, que dominou o Reino dos Cogumelos, e achar a magia que poderá levar Mario e Luigi de volta ao Brooklyn. Nas sextas-feiras, ao invés de um desenho do Mario, era exibido um desenho baseado em The Legend of Zelda. A série animada de Zelda é baseada no primeiro jogo The Legend of Zelda de NES, mas também inclui alguns poucos elementos de Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A premissa é que Link trabalha para o castelo de Hyrule, em missão de ajudar a princesa Zelda a proteger a Triforce da sabedoria (na dublagem, a Triforce é chamada apenas de Pirâmide) O malvado feiticeiro Ganon mora em um labirinto subterrâneo na Montanha da Morte, e ele conseguiu obter a Triforce do poder. Se alguém conseguir juntar as duas Triforces, poderá governar Hyrule para sempre. Em cada episódio, vemos um plano diferente de Ganon para roubar a Triforce da sabedoria, enquanto Link e Zelda também tentam roubar a Triforce do poder do Ganon. O Super Show foi a primeira série de desenhos animados do Mario feita pela DiC e durou 65 episódios, sendo eles 65 live-action, 52 episódios animados do Mario e 13 episódios animados de Zelda. Nos anos seguintes, foi continuada pelas séries The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 e Super Mario World em 1990 e 1991 respectivamente. No Brasil, o Super Show foi exibido na Rede Globo dentro do programa Xou da Xuxa a partir de 1991, mas não temos como confirmar em qual data ele saiu do ar. A dublagem da série foi realizada pelo estúdio Herbert Richers. A dublagem brasileira do Super Show é bem rara e só foi ser recuperada graças à um esforço coletivo de pessoas que gravaram o programa quando era exibido na TV, junto de alguns VHS portugueses que continham a dublagem brasileira. Por conta disso, vários episódios estão em qualidade ruim e com pedaços faltando. Mais da metade dos segmentos live-action continuam parcialmente perdidos e alguns episódios ainda não foram encontrados no geral. Os episódios de Zelda foram exibidos como um programa à parte, mas ainda dentro do Xou da Xuxa na Rede Globo em 1992. Até o momento, os episódios live-action desses episódios de Zelda não foram encontrados dublados pois nunca foram exibidos na TV. Em 1996, Zelda foi reprisado por um curto período de tempo durante as madrugadas. Ao contrário de Mario, Zelda não foi popular e por conta disso, muitos acreditavam até que a série não foi exibida no Brasil. Sua dublagem brasileira é extremamente rara e durante décadas foi motivo de mistério, até ser encontrada em 2018. Assim como os desenhos do Mario, a dublagem foi realizada pela Herbert Richers. NOTA: Os episódios \"Febre na Floresta\" e \"O Mario das Profundezas\" tem duas versões, uma da TV e outra do VHS da Globo Filmes. A única diferença entre as duas é que na versão de VHS, por algum motivo desconhecido, editaram as falas do Rei Koopa com um filtro de voz grave. O episódio live-action \"O Desaparecimento do Capitão Lou\" foi dublado duas vezes. Uma pro episódio animado \"Mario e Julieta\" e outra pro episódio \"Robô Koopa\". O episódio live-action \"Fake Bro\", que foi ao ar junto com \"Mario e Julieta\" em reprises nos EUA, nunca foi dublado, pois a dublagem foi feita de acordo com a exibição original onde esse episódio não era exibido.

Every episode contains English audio and subtitles, and the DVD rips have Spanish subtitles as well. Few Random Notes: The Peacock rips are in high-definition, although since these episodes presumably come from tape masters, it's not true HD (might as well add that they're pillarboxed and in 1920x1080) Episode 7 has some of the intro cut off for some reason The Season 3 captions seem to be much older than the ones for Seasons 1 and 2 (gives credit to Universal Cartoon Studios and the Media Access Group at WGBH) The first three episodes of Season 2 are thrown into the Season 1 order on Peacock, I reordered them for this archive The DVD rips come from my friend Cartoony Julie, check out her stuff: https://archive.org/details/@cartoonyjulio3 that's pretty much it, enjoy",

      "show": "Super Mario Bros. Super Show! e Zelda - Episódios Dublados - Português Brasil",
      "episode": "Ep. 09- A Grande Corrida de Moto - Mama Mia.mp4",
      "desc": "Este é um compilado de episódios dublados em português brasileiro do Super Mario Bros. Super Show, incluindo também os episódios dublados do desenho animado de The Legend of Zelda. Aqui estão todos os episódios dublados que foram encontrados ou disponibilizados na internet até o momento. Alguns estão incompletos ou com qualidade ruim, mas é tudo que acharam até agora. A maioria dos episódios foram retirados de gravações antigas da TV, mas tiveram alguns poucos que vieram de lançamentos em VHS. Os episódios passaram por remoção de ruído e foram restaurados pelo canal MaxwelThuthu do YouTube. Os episódios incompletos foram legendados nas partes que faltam. No caso de episódios com título em inglês, é porque estão incompletos e não sabemos os nomes brasileiros deles. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show foi uma série com segmentos live action e de desenho animado baseada nos jogos Super Mario Bros. e Super Mario Bros. 2 de Nintendo Entertainment System. Foi produzida pela DiC Entertainment e Saban. Nos Estados Unidos, foi originalmente exibida de segunda a sexta entre Setembro e Dezembro de 1989. Cada episódio era dividido em 2 segmentos. O primeiro é em live-action com Mario (Captain Lou Albano) e Luigi (Danny Wells) num formato sitcom, morando no Brooklyn e ajudando vários clientes com problemas de encanamento, muitas vezes celebridades da época. O segundo é um desenho animado baseado nos jogos com Mario, Luigi, Toad e a Princesa Toadstool viajando por vários lugares diferentes em busca de ajuda para derrotar o Rei Koopa, que dominou o Reino dos Cogumelos, e achar a magia que poderá levar Mario e Luigi de volta ao Brooklyn. Nas sextas-feiras, ao invés de um desenho do Mario, era exibido um desenho baseado em The Legend of Zelda. A série animada de Zelda é baseada no primeiro jogo The Legend of Zelda de NES, mas também inclui alguns poucos elementos de Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A premissa é que Link trabalha para o castelo de Hyrule, em missão de ajudar a princesa Zelda a proteger a Triforce da sabedoria (na dublagem, a Triforce é chamada apenas de Pirâmide) O malvado feiticeiro Ganon mora em um labirinto subterrâneo na Montanha da Morte, e ele conseguiu obter a Triforce do poder. Se alguém conseguir juntar as duas Triforces, poderá governar Hyrule para sempre. Em cada episódio, vemos um plano diferente de Ganon para roubar a Triforce da sabedoria, enquanto Link e Zelda também tentam roubar a Triforce do poder do Ganon. O Super Show foi a primeira série de desenhos animados do Mario feita pela DiC e durou 65 episódios, sendo eles 65 live-action, 52 episódios animados do Mario e 13 episódios animados de Zelda. Nos anos seguintes, foi continuada pelas séries The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 e Super Mario World em 1990 e 1991 respectivamente. No Brasil, o Super Show foi exibido na Rede Globo dentro do programa Xou da Xuxa a partir de 1991, mas não temos como confirmar em qual data ele saiu do ar. A dublagem da série foi realizada pelo estúdio Herbert Richers. A dublagem brasileira do Super Show é bem rara e só foi ser recuperada graças à um esforço coletivo de pessoas que gravaram o programa quando era exibido na TV, junto de alguns VHS portugueses que continham a dublagem brasileira. Por conta disso, vários episódios estão em qualidade ruim e com pedaços faltando. Mais da metade dos segmentos live-action continuam parcialmente perdidos e alguns episódios ainda não foram encontrados no geral. Os episódios de Zelda foram exibidos como um programa à parte, mas ainda dentro do Xou da Xuxa na Rede Globo em 1992. Até o momento, os episódios live-action desses episódios de Zelda não foram encontrados dublados pois nunca foram exibidos na TV. Em 1996, Zelda foi reprisado por um curto período de tempo durante as madrugadas. Ao contrário de Mario, Zelda não foi popular e por conta disso, muitos acreditavam até que a série não foi exibida no Brasil. Sua dublagem brasileira é extremamente rara e durante décadas foi motivo de mistério, até ser encontrada em 2018. Assim como os desenhos do Mario, a dublagem foi realizada pela Herbert Richers. NOTA: Os episódios \"Febre na Floresta\" e \"O Mario das Profundezas\" tem duas versões, uma da TV e outra do VHS da Globo Filmes. A única diferença entre as duas é que na versão de VHS, por algum motivo desconhecido, editaram as falas do Rei Koopa com um filtro de voz grave. O episódio live-action \"O Desaparecimento do Capitão Lou\" foi dublado duas vezes. Uma pro episódio animado \"Mario e Julieta\" e outra pro episódio \"Robô Koopa\". O episódio live-action \"Fake Bro\", que foi ao ar junto com \"Mario e Julieta\" em reprises nos EUA, nunca foi dublado, pois a dublagem foi feita de acordo com a exibição original onde esse episódio não era exibido.
