It was created by Norman Lear and produced by Alan Thicke as a spin-off /summer replacement from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman . It was a parody talk show , hosted by Barth Gimble ( Martin Mull ) and sidekick/announcer Jerry Hubbard ( Fred Willard ), complete with a stage band, \"Happy Kyne and the Mirthmakers\" (featuring Frank De Vol as the dour \"Happy\" Kyne, and Tommy Tedesco as one of the guitarists ). Barth was purportedly the twin brother of Garth Gimble from Mary Hartman . Like Mary Hartman , Fernwood 2 Night was set in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio. The show satirized real talk shows as well as the sort of fare one might expect from locally produced, small-town, midwestern American television programming. Well-known actors usually appeared playing characters or a contrivance had to be written for the celebrity to appear as themselves. (In one episode, Tom Waits 's tour bus happened to break down in Fernwood. [",

      "desc": "In 1985, Turner Program Services was given a 15-year contract by Tsuburaya Productions to broadcast Ultraseven (also known as ULTRA-7), a Japanese tokusatsu show in the Ultraman series which originally aired in Japan from 1967 to 1968. Tusburaya also provided Turner with a previous English dub of the series produced by Tsuburaya in the 1970's for Hawaiian television, but Turner found that dub to be lacking in quality. So, Turner commissioned Canadian production company Cinar to make a new dub of all 49 episodes of the series for syndication, which included new opening and closing credits and episode names, as well as a few name changes for certain characters (ex: the character Anne Yuri was named \"Donna Michibata\" in the dub). Additionally, the episodes were edited for violence, language, and commercial time, and new music cues would be inserted into the episodes. Initially unsatisfied with Cinar's dub, Turner shelved their dubbed version of Ultraseven from airing until 1994, where it was aired on TNT from 1994 to 2000, on the channel's \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" block aired edited versions of the episodes to make it more suitable towards younger viewers and the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" block aired the unedited versions of the Cinar dub episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Cinar dub were missing or mislabeled, and as a result, were never broadcasted on TV. These four episodes were never found, being lost media after they were produced in 1985 and shelved with the rest of the series. However, the show's twelfth episode, which was banned from airing in Japan, was dubbed by Cinar and shown on TNT along with the rest of the series. Additionally, clips of Ultraseven were used for several segments of Cartoon Planet , a show which aired on fellow Turner-owned channels Cartoon Network and TBS from 1995 to 1998. When Turner's contract for Ultraseven expired in 2001, all materials (videotapes, film reels, and master elements) were returned to Tsuburaya Productions. As a result, the Cinar dub of the show has not seen any official home video releases, nor has been rebroadcasted on television since 2000.",

This is only a small portion the notable moments that happened when comedians let loose on O&A, most clips are from around 2006-2009.

For those who have been following my updates on the O&A reddit boards, I recently spoke to Rosiebun1 who informed me that there was more to what he had and he would continue to send DVDs when he got the chance.

Should this series ever receive the proper full release, please support it.

Please share and seed. \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Torrent created by b4\" I chose to upload this release due to the substantial amount of transformative effort required to generate these files, as well as their marked difference from the original DVD-quality releases.

      "episode": "Ep. 08- Ame-os Mas Deixe-os - Imitando o Elvis.mp4",
      "desc": "Este é um compilado de episódios dublados em português brasileiro do Super Mario Bros. Super Show, incluindo também os episódios dublados do desenho animado de The Legend of Zelda. Aqui estão todos os episódios dublados que foram encontrados ou disponibilizados na internet até o momento. Alguns estão incompletos ou com qualidade ruim, mas é tudo que acharam até agora. A maioria dos episódios foram retirados de gravações antigas da TV, mas tiveram alguns poucos que vieram de lançamentos em VHS. Os episódios passaram por remoção de ruído e foram restaurados pelo canal MaxwelThuthu do YouTube. Os episódios incompletos foram legendados nas partes que faltam. No caso de episódios com título em inglês, é porque estão incompletos e não sabemos os nomes brasileiros deles. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show foi uma série com segmentos live action e de desenho animado baseada nos jogos Super Mario Bros. e Super Mario Bros. 2 de Nintendo Entertainment System. Foi produzida pela DiC Entertainment e Saban. Nos Estados Unidos, foi originalmente exibida de segunda a sexta entre Setembro e Dezembro de 1989. Cada episódio era dividido em 2 segmentos. O primeiro é em live-action com Mario (Captain Lou Albano) e Luigi (Danny Wells) num formato sitcom, morando no Brooklyn e ajudando vários clientes com problemas de encanamento, muitas vezes celebridades da época. O segundo é um desenho animado baseado nos jogos com Mario, Luigi, Toad e a Princesa Toadstool viajando por vários lugares diferentes em busca de ajuda para derrotar o Rei Koopa, que dominou o Reino dos Cogumelos, e achar a magia que poderá levar Mario e Luigi de volta ao Brooklyn. Nas sextas-feiras, ao invés de um desenho do Mario, era exibido um desenho baseado em The Legend of Zelda. A série animada de Zelda é baseada no primeiro jogo The Legend of Zelda de NES, mas também inclui alguns poucos elementos de Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A premissa é que Link trabalha para o castelo de Hyrule, em missão de ajudar a princesa Zelda a proteger a Triforce da sabedoria (na dublagem, a Triforce é chamada apenas de Pirâmide) O malvado feiticeiro Ganon mora em um labirinto subterrâneo na Montanha da Morte, e ele conseguiu obter a Triforce do poder. Se alguém conseguir juntar as duas Triforces, poderá governar Hyrule para sempre. Em cada episódio, vemos um plano diferente de Ganon para roubar a Triforce da sabedoria, enquanto Link e Zelda também tentam roubar a Triforce do poder do Ganon. O Super Show foi a primeira série de desenhos animados do Mario feita pela DiC e durou 65 episódios, sendo eles 65 live-action, 52 episódios animados do Mario e 13 episódios animados de Zelda. Nos anos seguintes, foi continuada pelas séries The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 e Super Mario World em 1990 e 1991 respectivamente. No Brasil, o Super Show foi exibido na Rede Globo dentro do programa Xou da Xuxa a partir de 1991, mas não temos como confirmar em qual data ele saiu do ar. A dublagem da série foi realizada pelo estúdio Herbert Richers. A dublagem brasileira do Super Show é bem rara e só foi ser recuperada graças à um esforço coletivo de pessoas que gravaram o programa quando era exibido na TV, junto de alguns VHS portugueses que continham a dublagem brasileira. Por conta disso, vários episódios estão em qualidade ruim e com pedaços faltando. Mais da metade dos segmentos live-action continuam parcialmente perdidos e alguns episódios ainda não foram encontrados no geral. Os episódios de Zelda foram exibidos como um programa à parte, mas ainda dentro do Xou da Xuxa na Rede Globo em 1992. Até o momento, os episódios live-action desses episódios de Zelda não foram encontrados dublados pois nunca foram exibidos na TV. Em 1996, Zelda foi reprisado por um curto período de tempo durante as madrugadas. Ao contrário de Mario, Zelda não foi popular e por conta disso, muitos acreditavam até que a série não foi exibida no Brasil. Sua dublagem brasileira é extremamente rara e durante décadas foi motivo de mistério, até ser encontrada em 2018. Assim como os desenhos do Mario, a dublagem foi realizada pela Herbert Richers. NOTA: Os episódios \"Febre na Floresta\" e \"O Mario das Profundezas\" tem duas versões, uma da TV e outra do VHS da Globo Filmes. A única diferença entre as duas é que na versão de VHS, por algum motivo desconhecido, editaram as falas do Rei Koopa com um filtro de voz grave. O episódio live-action \"O Desaparecimento do Capitão Lou\" foi dublado duas vezes. Uma pro episódio animado \"Mario e Julieta\" e outra pro episódio \"Robô Koopa\". O episódio live-action \"Fake Bro\", que foi ao ar junto com \"Mario e Julieta\" em reprises nos EUA, nunca foi dublado, pois a dublagem foi feita de acordo com a exibição original onde esse episódio não era exibido.

The Omni Productions dub is actually the second one rather than last, with Super God Masterforce being the first one dubbed oddly enough.

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain.

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "Freakazoid! is an American superhero comedy animated television series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini and developed by Tom Ruegger for the Kids' WB programming block of The WB. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who battles with a bizarre array of supervillains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Bruce Timm, best known as a major principal of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, and the humor is unique in its inclusions of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor and pop cultural references. The series was one of the first to debut on the new Kids' WB Saturday morning block of The WB, on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. considered renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.

The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video.

As the SR99-Kirby uploads have become outdated, I've taken it upon myself to provide you with these enhanced collections. The collection is painstakingly curated from multiple sources, mostly YouTube, Animation Nations recordings of the MeTV versions, FuriousMan226, Cartoony Julio and Many Others. Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

This is archive of All Gas No Brakes YouTube channel's Patreon content, that had uncut & extra videos for patreons. Originally downloaded from TPB . Why? Isn't this stealing? Yes technically and no morally speaking. Even though Patreon of this channel still exists, Andrew Callaghan (reporter and creator of AGNB) and the film crew doesn't get any money from it anymore because contract expired in early 2021. Now \"Doing Things Media\" (company that made the deal) gets 100% of the profits. And before that, AGNB only got 40% of the profits ( read more about it on NYT, it explains everything on detail ). I personally don't think that \"Doing Things Media\" deserves the profits because of shitty contract Andrew did. Even when Andrew admits it was a dumb move to sign the contract without reading carefully, I don't morally support companies that screws people like this, specially when they were so heavily against AGNB doing political content (IMO, videos related to far right and showing far rights true colors was their best content). Also, extra points for \"Doing Things Media\" being a \"meme viral ad company\" , yuck. Why videos are choppy? Videos are only choppy when you view them on the web browser. I tested original downloaded videos on Brave and Firefox, same choppiness happens. So unless browsers get fixes related to this (unlikely), you need to download the videos to your storage space and use media player. I don't have storage space, I have to stream it somehow without choppiness! Okay, there's one solution, but it's not great either (I highly recommend just downloading the files you want). I made M3U8 playlist for streaming outside of the browser (right-click or long press the link -> \"Save link as...\"). Open this playlist with VLC video player (or other video player that supports M3U8 files) and you can now stream the videos. But beware, because Archive.org doesn't have high speed servers, viewing experience isn't greatest and videos often buffers. Where's YouTube content? You can find it from here . There's another archive that was uploaded before I did, but it's not as good . Where's content of X? I don't know, don't ask me. I only uploaded video (and image) files from the torrent.",

      "desc": "Disclaimer: I do not own this series. All That belongs to Paramount Global. All songs sung in the rounds of sound (the celebrity musical performances at the end of each episode) belong to the celebrities who sang them. All That can be considered a junior counterpart to Saturday Night Live . Featuring such names as Alisa Reyes, Amanda Bynes, Danny Tamberelli (of The Adventures of Pete and Pete fame), Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Lori Beth Denberg, Nick Cannon, and even a then-unknown Gabriel Iglesias, this sketch comedy series ran in three separate runs. The original run, covered here, ran for six seasons from 1994 to 2000, the first reboot, with an entirely new cast, ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2005, and the second reboot, also with a new cast but with return appearances from some of the cast members from the original run, aired ten episodes in 2019 (and were it not for a certain world-changing event that shall not be named, there would be more episodes of it). My concern here will be only with the original series and the \"Best Of\" clip show specials featuring clips from it. In addition to its many guest stars and giving rise to several other live-action Nickelodeon shows in the nineties and early 2000s (namely Kenan and Kel and The Amanda Show , the latter of which, whether directly or indirectly, gave rise to even more shows like Drake and Josh ), All That is notable for launching the careers of several actors and musicians, with some still being successful to this day (namely Gabriel Iglesias and Kenan Thompson), and some others... not so much. Note: As with my Life Is Wild uploads, some episodes are in better quality than others. Also, because some of these episodes were recorded from reruns on the old TeenNick programming block NickRewind (formerly The Nineties Are All That), which cut the rounds of sound and the mini sketches leading up to them from its airings of the show, some episodes are shorter than others. Missing Episodes: Season 6 Episode 1: B*Witched; Special: The Best of Josh Server; Special: The Best of Lori Beth Denberg, Special: The Best of Tunes into TV; Special: Dates, Goats, and Romance; and Special: Music and More Backstage Pass 2.",

      "desc": "Take that Wayne [Disclaimer: The religious beliefs and ideals presented in this archive do not reflect the core beliefs, ideals, and interests of {{the user that uploaded this}}. View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there. If there are better copies I'm unaware of, rest assured that this collection will be promptly updated. If newer shorts versions are released, the collection will be updated frequently whenever I get to it. Anyways enjoy :)",

It was made between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series, totalling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were filmed; production ended with the completion of the sixth episode of the second series after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his bid to sell the programme to American network television. Set in the 2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls , Supercar , Fireball XL5 and Stingray . It follows the exploits of International Rescue, a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from the organisation's secret base of operations in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, leader of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. Thunderbirds debuted in September 1965 on the ITV network . The series was exported to around 30 countries during the 1960s. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. Besides tie-in merchandise, the series has been followed by two feature film sequels – Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 – as well as an anime adaptation, a mime theatre show and a live-action film. A remake series premiered in 2015; the same year, three new episodes, based on tie-in audio plays and made using the same techniques as the original series, were created to mark its 50th anniversary. Other shows produced were Joe 90 , Captain Scarlet , Space 1999 Season1 and Season2 and UFO . The latter 2 series being live action.",

This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

Which is a testament to my dedication. It includes some logoless uncropped versions, some of which are restored, and some of which are the '90s versions. However, please be aware that this collection reflects what I consider the best versions of the shorts out there.
