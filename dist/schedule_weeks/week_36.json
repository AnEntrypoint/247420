      "desc": "In 1985, Turner Program Services was given a 15-year contract by Tsuburaya Productions to broadcast Ultraseven (also known as ULTRA-7), a Japanese tokusatsu show in the Ultraman series which originally aired in Japan from 1967 to 1968. Tusburaya also provided Turner with a previous English dub of the series produced by Tsuburaya in the 1970's for Hawaiian television, but Turner found that dub to be lacking in quality. So, Turner commissioned Canadian production company Cinar to make a new dub of all 49 episodes of the series for syndication, which included new opening and closing credits and episode names, as well as a few name changes for certain characters (ex: the character Anne Yuri was named \"Donna Michibata\" in the dub). Additionally, the episodes were edited for violence, language, and commercial time, and new music cues would be inserted into the episodes. Initially unsatisfied with Cinar's dub, Turner shelved their dubbed version of Ultraseven from airing until 1994, where it was aired on TNT from 1994 to 2000, on the channel's \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" block aired edited versions of the episodes to make it more suitable towards younger viewers and the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" block aired the unedited versions of the Cinar dub episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Cinar dub were missing or mislabeled, and as a result, were never broadcasted on TV. These four episodes were never found, being lost media after they were produced in 1985 and shelved with the rest of the series. However, the show's twelfth episode, which was banned from airing in Japan, was dubbed by Cinar and shown on TNT along with the rest of the series. Additionally, clips of Ultraseven were used for several segments of Cartoon Planet , a show which aired on fellow Turner-owned channels Cartoon Network and TBS from 1995 to 1998. When Turner's contract for Ultraseven expired in 2001, all materials (videotapes, film reels, and master elements) were returned to Tsuburaya Productions. As a result, the Cinar dub of the show has not seen any official home video releases, nor has been rebroadcasted on television since 2000.",

All airings are identical right down to the quick clips segments. Two, the lengths of the files fluctuate due to some having more commercials than others but all the cartoons are still there. Unfortunately my copy of The Tom & Jerry Show from March 18th was missing the cartoons Give & Tyke and The Cuckoo Clock so until I can fix that, there's not much I can do.

      "desc": "The Fuccons ( / ˈ f uː ˌ k ɒ n s / ), known as Oh! Mikey ( オー！マイキー , Ō! Maikī ) in Japan, is a Japanese sketch comedy series created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi . It features the Fuccons, a family of American expatriates living in Japan, with characters played by mannequins filmed at various locations in real-time. The Fuccons first aired as recurring sketches titled The Fuccon Family ( フーコン・ファミリー , Fūkon Famirī ) on the Japanese sketch comedy series Vermilion Pleasure Night in 2000, which was also produced by Ishibashi. In January 2002, the series moved to its own late-night time slot and was broadcast until 2005 for a total of eight seasons. Throughout its broadcast, a 2003 film titled Wah! Mikey Returns was released in theaters. Following its release, four more series was released direct-to-video as well as the 2007 theatrical film Oh! Mikey Fever . Both The Fuccon Family and The Fuccons were screened at various film festivals overseas, where news of the series was spread on the Internet through word-of-mouth, gaining a cult following. ADV Films licensed the first four seasons for North American distribution with an English dub, which was later broadcast on Anime Network and G4 as part of G4's Late Night Peepshow . Overview [ edit ] The Fuccons is centered on Mikey Fuccon, an American expatriate who has moved to Japan after his father's job transfer. All the characters are depicted as mannequins filmed in various locations in real-time, [3] while dressed up in post-World War II fashion . [1] [3] The mannequins' movements are minimal, limiting movement to uncomplicated actions, and their poses change off-camera. [4] Voice acting and camera angles are used to convey the story. [5] The episodes feature non sequitur dialogue and occasionally include surreal humor , [6] with every episode ending with all characters laughing. [1] [4] The characters usually face conflict in bizarre, outlandish situations in non-continuous storylines. [4] The original Fuccon Family sketches on Vermilion Pleasure Night were described as James and Barbara constantly arguing and threatening to kill each other with \"giant smiles\" on their faces, [1] while bonding over sex and tormenting Mikey. [7] Mikey encounters problems of his own such as being neglected by his parents, being kidnapped, or being possessed by a demon, to varying degrees of absurdity. [1] Each episode is approximately 3 minutes. [1] [3]",

Additionally, this collection also includes the grand majority of the music released by Joji around the time the Filthy Frank character was active. There's over 150 tracks between 2009 - 2017. This was a labor of love to collect, but someone needed to do it. Update Regarding Torrent: (Feb 2024) I hear everyone about the torrent not being updated, I am just not able to do anything about it right this second. Life things are happening, but I assure you that when I get the chance I will make it all happen. Also, don't worry about any of this being lost to time. I have all of these files backed up and archival BDs in case of hard drive failures.",

Super Show! is an American live-action / animated television series that aired from September 4 to December 1, 1989, in syndication . The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

This is archive of All Gas No Brakes YouTube channel's Patreon content, that had uncut & extra videos for patreons. Originally downloaded from TPB . Why? Isn't this stealing? Yes technically and no morally speaking. Even though Patreon of this channel still exists, Andrew Callaghan (reporter and creator of AGNB) and the film crew doesn't get any money from it anymore because contract expired in early 2021. Now \"Doing Things Media\" (company that made the deal) gets 100% of the profits. And before that, AGNB only got 40% of the profits ( read more about it on NYT, it explains everything on detail ). I personally don't think that \"Doing Things Media\" deserves the profits because of shitty contract Andrew did. Even when Andrew admits it was a dumb move to sign the contract without reading carefully, I don't morally support companies that screws people like this, specially when they were so heavily against AGNB doing political content (IMO, videos related to far right and showing far rights true colors was their best content). Also, extra points for \"Doing Things Media\" being a \"meme viral ad company\" , yuck. Why videos are choppy? Videos are only choppy when you view them on the web browser. I tested original downloaded videos on Brave and Firefox, same choppiness happens. So unless browsers get fixes related to this (unlikely), you need to download the videos to your storage space and use media player. I don't have storage space, I have to stream it somehow without choppiness! Okay, there's one solution, but it's not great either (I highly recommend just downloading the files you want). I made M3U8 playlist for streaming outside of the browser (right-click or long press the link -> \"Save link as...\"). Open this playlist with VLC video player (or other video player that supports M3U8 files) and you can now stream the videos. But beware, because Archive.org doesn't have high speed servers, viewing experience isn't greatest and videos often buffers. Where's YouTube content? You can find it from here . There's another archive that was uploaded before I did, but it's not as good . Where's content of X? I don't know, don't ask me. I only uploaded video (and image) files from the torrent.",

      "desc": "In 1985, Turner Program Services was given a 15-year contract by Tsuburaya Productions to broadcast Ultraseven (also known as ULTRA-7), a Japanese tokusatsu show in the Ultraman series which originally aired in Japan from 1967 to 1968. Tusburaya also provided Turner with a previous English dub of the series produced by Tsuburaya in the 1970's for Hawaiian television, but Turner found that dub to be lacking in quality. So, Turner commissioned Canadian production company Cinar to make a new dub of all 49 episodes of the series for syndication, which included new opening and closing credits and episode names, as well as a few name changes for certain characters (ex: the character Anne Yuri was named \"Donna Michibata\" in the dub). Additionally, the episodes were edited for violence, language, and commercial time, and new music cues would be inserted into the episodes. Initially unsatisfied with Cinar's dub, Turner shelved their dubbed version of Ultraseven from airing until 1994, where it was aired on TNT from 1994 to 2000, on the channel's \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" block aired edited versions of the episodes to make it more suitable towards younger viewers and the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" block aired the unedited versions of the Cinar dub episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Cinar dub were missing or mislabeled, and as a result, were never broadcasted on TV. These four episodes were never found, being lost media after they were produced in 1985 and shelved with the rest of the series. However, the show's twelfth episode, which was banned from airing in Japan, was dubbed by Cinar and shown on TNT along with the rest of the series. Additionally, clips of Ultraseven were used for several segments of Cartoon Planet , a show which aired on fellow Turner-owned channels Cartoon Network and TBS from 1995 to 1998. When Turner's contract for Ultraseven expired in 2001, all materials (videotapes, film reels, and master elements) were returned to Tsuburaya Productions. As a result, the Cinar dub of the show has not seen any official home video releases, nor has been rebroadcasted on television since 2000.",

      "desc": "You may be asking yourself, “What the fuck is this shit?” Back in 1993, a small, family-owned, Filipino dubbing company named the Creative Products Corporation created an English dub of Dragon Ball Z. The first ever English dub for the series, in fact, and second English dub of the franchise as a whole, so long as you don’t believe in the shithole of Frontier Enterprises. Now, you might also be asking yourself, “Why the fuck should I care?” To be honest with you, you probably shouldn’t, but the reason I and many other people do is because it’s some major, juicy lost media. Creative dubbed the first 26 episodes of DBZ in '93 and later on in early 1996 they continued where they had left off and carried it to episode 49. That’s all fine and dandy, but how many of those 49 episodes do we have? …11. All of which are from the 1993 run, which was lower in quality. Regardless, I’ve taken what few episodes exist, thrown away the old shitty video that these came with, and have synced them to Seed of Mght’s DBZ release. For any dub or preservation enthusiasts, take heart. If you’ve heard the original files, you should know that they sound pretty awful. Just letting it be known that I did nothing to try and fix the audio. I’m just here to sync, a’ight. Fix it yourself if you care so damn much. In case anyone cares, yes, the audio is from the original files uploaded to the Internet Archive, not the shitty MP4’s that they auto generate. I may be stupid, but I have some level of competency. Since this dub is based on the Japanese version, any segments that are missing use Japanese to fill in the gaps. The gaps use audio-leveled Japanese DBOX audio. The only exception being the NEPs, which sometimes use a karaoke of CHA-LA (depending on the episode). The subtitles here fills in the Japanese gaps with SoM English subs so that they can still be understood via casual viewing. Some scenes are also just straight up left in Japanese in the dub, so those few instances have subs as well. Anyways, 'Benko out. Eat ass, smoke grass, and sled fast. \"Dragon Ball\" (Alt. Dragonball, DragonBall) is property of Akira Toriyama, Toei Animation, Fuji TV, and Shueisha. I claim to own nothing. © 1998/2020 Toei Animation, Ltd",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

A spin-off of Perfect Strangers, the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast.[3] Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted show that started in the 1980s and lasts longer in continuous production is The Simpsons.",

It was produced by Universal Television and animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment) and distributed, through first-run syndication, by MCA TV, years before the latter company became NBC U niversal Television Distribution. Renowned Japanese animation director Osamu Dezaki was involved as chief supervising director, and his distinctive style is evident throughout all its episodes. Character designs were by Yūki Nobuteru . The title characters of the series are a family of machine-enhanced human beings each possessing unique powers after being augmented with bionic technology. Each family member is given specific bionic powers, and thus they form a superhero team called the Bionic Six. The series was initiated as to be about the Austin family. For creative reasons, this was changed early on in preproductions.",

There will be plans to provide more subs in the future. The subs are soft-coded and require a media player that supports this feature. I would recommend VLC Media Player.

      "desc": "WARNING! Some of the videos and images are not safe for work , viewer discretion is advised. What is this? This is archive of All Gas No Brakes YouTube channel's Patreon content, that had uncut & extra videos for patreons. Originally downloaded from TPB . Why? Isn't this stealing? Yes technically and no morally speaking. Even though Patreon of this channel still exists, Andrew Callaghan (reporter and creator of AGNB) and the film crew doesn't get any money from it anymore because contract expired in early 2021. Now \"Doing Things Media\" (company that made the deal) gets 100% of the profits. And before that, AGNB only got 40% of the profits ( read more about it on NYT, it explains everything on detail ). I personally don't think that \"Doing Things Media\" deserves the profits because of shitty contract Andrew did. Even when Andrew admits it was a dumb move to sign the contract without reading carefully, I don't morally support companies that screws people like this, specially when they were so heavily against AGNB doing political content (IMO, videos related to far right and showing far rights true colors was their best content). Also, extra points for \"Doing Things Media\" being a \"meme viral ad company\" , yuck. Why videos are choppy? Videos are only choppy when you view them on the web browser. I tested original downloaded videos on Brave and Firefox, same choppiness happens. So unless browsers get fixes related to this (unlikely), you need to download the videos to your storage space and use media player. I don't have storage space, I have to stream it somehow without choppiness! Okay, there's one solution, but it's not great either (I highly recommend just downloading the files you want). I made M3U8 playlist for streaming outside of the browser (right-click or long press the link -> \"Save link as...\"). Open this playlist with VLC video player (or other video player that supports M3U8 files) and you can now stream the videos. But beware, because Archive.org doesn't have high speed servers, viewing experience isn't greatest and videos often buffers. Where's YouTube content? You can find it from here . There's another archive that was uploaded before I did, but it's not as good . Where's content of X? I don't know, don't ask me. I only uploaded video (and image) files from the torrent.",

The difference between the old LD version and the later DVD/BD releases is that the newer versions have digitally redrawn scenes that look strange, distracting and out of place, this old LD version does not have that issue and is entirely hand drawn. This rip contains: -640x480p video at ~1246kbps -MP3 audio at 192kbps -Hard-coded English subtitles by Central Anime -The original animations with no alterations Keep in mind this is an old rip and it does not look very good but is the only release online of the full LaserDisc version of the show, this was ripped and subtitled by Central Anime in 2010 or so I believe or maybe even before that. The video suffers from being encoded at a low video bitrate and having hard-coded subtitles permanently burned into the video. LaserDisc can actually look just as good as DVD or even better if it is properly ripped.

View at your own description]. Dear Kevinsano, This may the be the strangest message you'll ever receive but I do hope you'll take the time to read it and consider what I have to say. To put it simply, I would really appreciate it if the next time your birthday comes around you would request that your clop artist friends (who like to give you sexually oriented pony art as gifts) draw some pony other than Twilight Sparkle for you. The reason I ask this is that Twilight is my fiance, and we're planning on getting married next June or July should everything go as planned financially speaking. And yes, I have actually found a wedding chapel that will let me marry someone that most people would consider a fictional character. Now before you go thinking \"This guy is either completely crazy or just screwing with me.\" please hear me out on this. You see, I'm totally head over heels in love with Twilight Sparkle. I have been for about 11 months now and at this point I'm in a committed relationship with my Twiley. By that I mean I don't date anyone else, I don't sleep with anyone else, and I have zero interest in having any kind of relationship with anyone other than the mare I adore. I love her with all my heart and I'm 100% committed to that love. To express my love in a real tangible way I have a beautiful hand made custom Twilight Sparkle plushie that I can hug, kiss, cuddle up in bed to go to sleep with at night, and take out on the town to do all the fun things together that normal couples do. I take her out to eat at nice vegetarian restaurants, we go shopping together, I take her out for coffee, we do social activities together like hanging out with friends, seeing movies, etc. And I talk about her as if she is Twilight, because to me she very much is. When I look at her I see Twilight Sparkle. When I talk with her I'm talking with Twilight. When I hold her in my arms and kiss her there are no doubts in my mind that it's the mare I love who's lips are pressed against mine. And every morning when I open my eyes and see her head on the pillow next to mine, with her gorgeous violet eyes staring back at me, I can't help but wonder how I ever got to be so lucky as to have a partner as smart, funny, beautiful, and all around wonderful as her. All my friends and the people who know me well say that my love is a thing of beauty and quite admirable, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't know me you're probably going \"Wow. That's pretty damn crazy.\" and wondering why I don't just go get a real girlfriend. The truth is I've had plenty of real relationships and sexual partners in the 27 years I've been around. A few short relationships, one that lasted 7 years, and a total of 6 different sexual partners. So my love for Twilight isn't out of a lack of real world intimacy or relationships, I just fell in love with her and my heart didn't give me much of a choice in the matter. But you know what? I'm totally happy with my love and my relationship. It may seem weird to you, but it fils me with joy every single day of my life and I've never been happier. So what if it's weird? If it makes me happy and it doesn't hurt anyone then where's the problem? I don't think there is one, and anyone who knows me well will tell you the same. Now your probably wondering why I'm telling you all this and how it concerns you. To you I'm sure Twilight Sparkle is just a cartoon character you think is really hot, so I imagine you wouldn't think anything of having your friends draw sexually explicit art of her as birthday gifts for you. And hey, I think she's really attractive too so I get where you're coming from there. I often go on e621.net and Rule34.Paheal to see what new erotic art people have drawn of her. But to me she's more than a cartoon character who's sexually attractive, she's my fiance who I love with all my heart and soon to be my wife. So it's been bothering me lately every time I go on those sites and see a dozen or so pieces of art people have drawn depicting my girl in various sexual situations with the same person over and over, and that person happens to be you. Don't get me wrong here though, this isn't a jealousy thing. I'm very secure in my relationship. I know without question that Twilight is just as faithful to me as I am to her, she's actually sitting on the couch next to me reading while I type this. She's very real to me and I know she's not sneaking out in the middle of the night to go have kinky sex with some famous artist. And I do respect your talent as an artist and an artist's creative freedom to draw whatever they want, that's cool. What bothers me is that in all these birthday images you've been getting Twilight is always depicted as if she was your sexual plaything, drawn wearing a collar with your name on it or with a speech bubble saying something that would somehow suggest she was your property. And I know quite well that Twilight Sparkle is not your plaything nor your property, she's my fiance. So that bugs me a bit. What I find really loathsome though is your pension for degrading my partner in both your art and the fan art you've been receiving lately. Twiley is a sweet and fairly vanilla little mare who I treat with the utmost love and respect, and she definitely does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of sexual slave who likes being dressed up in sleazy attire, wearing a coller, getting sodomized, and having her face ejaculated on. She's not into that kinda stuff and the fact that there's someone out there inthe world such as yourself who would desire to treat Twilight that way, and have his friends support and validate his desires to demean and mistreat my partner by drawing pictures of him doing so, really does bother me. I don't take any issue with people having kinky sex as long as both parties consent to it and enjoy it, but I know quite well that my Twiley has no desire whatsoever to be treated like that. So next year, when your birthday comes around, keep in mind that Twilight Sparkle isn't just a lifeless cartoon character to be objectified for your sexual gratification. She's the partner of someone who loves her very much, and by that time their wife. So both myself and Twiley would greatly appreciate it if you'd pick someone else to request erotic art of four birthday. Based on the very large amount of different ponies you draw art of I imagine there has to be many other ponies you find sexually attractive. I assume you'll probably just dismiss this message as the ramblings of a crazy person and likely ignore it, but if by chance you do take what I've had to say to heart, well... we'd appreciate it.

This is archive of All Gas No Brakes YouTube channel's Patreon content, that had uncut & extra videos for patreons. Originally downloaded from TPB . Why? Isn't this stealing? Yes technically and no morally speaking. Even though Patreon of this channel still exists, Andrew Callaghan (reporter and creator of AGNB) and the film crew doesn't get any money from it anymore because contract expired in early 2021. Now \"Doing Things Media\" (company that made the deal) gets 100% of the profits. And before that, AGNB only got 40% of the profits ( read more about it on NYT, it explains everything on detail ). I personally don't think that \"Doing Things Media\" deserves the profits because of shitty contract Andrew did. Even when Andrew admits it was a dumb move to sign the contract without reading carefully, I don't morally support companies that screws people like this, specially when they were so heavily against AGNB doing political content (IMO, videos related to far right and showing far rights true colors was their best content). Also, extra points for \"Doing Things Media\" being a \"meme viral ad company\" , yuck. Why videos are choppy? Videos are only choppy when you view them on the web browser. I tested original downloaded videos on Brave and Firefox, same choppiness happens. So unless browsers get fixes related to this (unlikely), you need to download the videos to your storage space and use media player. I don't have storage space, I have to stream it somehow without choppiness! Okay, there's one solution, but it's not great either (I highly recommend just downloading the files you want). I made M3U8 playlist for streaming outside of the browser (right-click or long press the link -> \"Save link as...\"). Open this playlist with VLC video player (or other video player that supports M3U8 files) and you can now stream the videos. But beware, because Archive.org doesn't have high speed servers, viewing experience isn't greatest and videos often buffers. Where's YouTube content? You can find it from here . There's another archive that was uploaded before I did, but it's not as good . Where's content of X? I don't know, don't ask me. I only uploaded video (and image) files from the torrent.",

Super Show! is an American live-action / animated television series that aired from September 4 to December 1, 1989, in syndication . The series is based on the video games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 by Nintendo , and is the first of three television series to be based upon the Mario video game series. [1] The animation was provided by Sei Young Animation . Each episode consists of live-action segments starring WWF Hall of Fame wrestler \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi alongside a special guest, either as themselves or a character for the segments. The remainder of the program is dedicated to animated stories of Super Mario Bros. , starring the voices of Albano and Wells in their respective roles, which were exhibited Monday through Thursday. The Friday episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! was instead accompanied by animated serials based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. A sequel series based on Super Mario Bros. 3 aired the following year, followed by another show based on Super Mario World the year after that.",

La 1er temporada de la serie estaba dirigida principalmente al público joven y adulto por el cual presentaba un humor más adulto con detalles un poco grotescos, rasgos y expresiones más exageradas y amorfas en los personajes y algunos diálogos que hacían referencia al tabaco y al alcohol. A partir de la 2da temporada se retiró de la serie a uno de los extraterrestres, Stereo Monovici, ya que según los mismos creadores presentaba un carisma muy pobre y sin mucha participación en la primera temporada, haciendo solo pequeñas apariciones en algunos capítulos de la segunda temporada y quedando solo los 4 restantes como personajes principales. El contenido se adaptó más al público en general. Prueba de ello podemos comparar y diferenciar el contenido de los episodios donde se disminuyen ciertos detalles de humor adulto, como el estiércol en donde cae la nave en la canción de entrada con apariencia más grotesca en la primera temporada y se disminuyen los rasgos y expresiones faciales exageradas y amorfas, entre otras cosas.",

La série met en scène les aventures de quatre enfants d'école primaire : Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman et Kenny McCormick qui vivent à South Park , petite ville du Colorado . Son humour se veut absurde, parodique, sarcastique, graveleux et scatologique, et elle est souvent une critique et une satire de la société américaine. Mais c'est bien son ton très provocateur et ses dialogues souvent grossiers qui la distinguent dans le paysage audiovisuel. Depuis ses débuts, ses auteurs bénéficient d'une très grande liberté assez rare pour une série sur le câble américain. Bien que controversée, la série est récompensée à de nombreuses reprises, notamment par cinq Emmy Awards , ainsi qu'un Peabody Award . La popularité de la série aboutit, deux ans après ses débuts, à la création du long métrage South Park, le film . Le 5 août 2021, la série est renouvelée jusqu'en 2027 soit jusqu’à la saison 30 et quatorze téléfilms produits exclusivement pour la plateforme Paramount+ sont prévus. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Liste détaillée des Épisodes ☆ ☆ ☆ Accès direct aux saisons : (re-cliquez sur le lien) Saison 01 - 1997-1998 - 13 épisodes Saison 02 - 1998-1999 - 18 épisodes Saison 03 - 1999-2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 04 - 2000 - 17 épisodes Saison 05 - 2001 - 14 épisodes Saison 06 - 2002 - 17 épisodes Saison 07 - 2003 - 15 épisodes Saison 08 - 2004 - 14 épisodes Saison 09 - 2005 - 14 épisodes Saison 10 - 2006 - 14 épisodes Saison 11 - 2007 - 14 épisodes Saison 12 - 2008 - 14 épisodes Saison 13 - 2009 - 14 épisodes Saison 14 - 2010 - 14 épisodes Saison 15 - 2011 - 14 épisodes Saison 16 - 2012 - 14 épisodes Saison 17 - 2013 - 10 épisodes Saison 18 - 2014 - 10 épisodes Saison 19 - 2015 - 10 épisodes Saison 20 - 2016 - 10 épisodes Saison 21 - 2017 - 10 épisodes Saison 22 - 2018 - 10 épisodes Saison 23 - 2019 - 10 épisodes Saison 24 - 2021-2021 - 4 épisodes Saison 25 - 2022 - 6 épisodes VOstFR + 2 VF Saison 26 - 2023-2024 - 9 épisodes. + de Dessins Animés avec les épisodes de Les Simpson ☆ La Série en VF : ICI !

This is part of the revered Arabic-Anime-Archivist/enthusist Fahad Al-Zeyara (formely known by the online persona \"Fahad Al-Qatari\")'s fantastic quality resotrations of many beloved Arabic dubbed Anime to air on his 5 year-long-running programming block \"Ayam-Zaman, Good Ol' Days\". Note: These restorations happen to have added censorship onto nudity that wasn't originally filtered out in the Arabic dubs, this dub being no exception. Massive, and I mean MASSIVE Shout-out to CTGeniusBoy, Moayed01 and all the Incredible and Supportive people at BilArabi's Telegram groupchat for providing fruitfull amount of treasure-quality archives like this one!
